Our Cargo Systems unit was selected in June 2005 to provide cargo loading systems for the Airbus A400M Military Transport Aircraft ("A400M"). We have incurred significant engineering and development costs in connection with this program (see Note 12 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements), and we expect to incur additional development costs as the design is certified. The certification of our design for full functionality is currently scheduled for the third quarter of calendar 2014. In July 2013, we and Airbus amended the A400M contract to make changes to the Company's role and responsibilities under the program, establish a fixed price per shipset, set applicable weight parameters and make certain other changes.

We may not be able to recover our engineering and development costs, which could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition, under certain circumstances, including the following: (i) we are not able to obtain certification of the design of the system in the third quarter of calendar 2014; (ii) the A400M program experiences significant additional delivery delays or order cancellations; (iii) we fail to achieve the expected production cost reductions; (iv) we fail to deliver the items that we are now responsible for in accordance with the terms of the amended contract; or (v) the contract is further amended to change our role and responsibilities.

Our Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Management has made estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities to prepare the Consolidated Financial Statements. The most significant estimates made by management include those related to the allowance for doubtful accounts, assumptions used in assessing goodwill impairment, adjustments to reduce the value of inventories and aviation equipment on or available for lease, revenue recognition, loss accruals for aviation equipment operating leases, program development costs and assumptions used in determining pension plan obligations. Accordingly, actual results could differ materially from those estimates. The following is a summary of the accounting policies considered critical by management.

As of May 31, 2014 and 2013, we have capitalized, net of reimbursements, $139.8 million and $130.9 million, respectively, of costs associated with the engineering and development of the cargo system. Sales and related cost of sales are recognized on the units of delivery method. In determining the recoverability of the capitalized program development costs, we have made certain judgments and estimates concerning expected revenues and the cost to manufacture the A400M cargo system. Differences between actual results and our assumptions may result in our not fully recovering program development costs, which could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.

Our Cargo Systems unit was selected in June 2005 to provide cargo loading systems for the Airbus A400M Military Transport Aircraft ("A400M"). We have incurred significant engineering and development costs in connection with this program (see Note 15 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements), and we expect to incur additional costs until final design approval, which is currently scheduled for the first calendar quarter of 2014. In July 2013, we and Airbus amended the A400M contract to make changes to the Company's role and responsibilities under the program, establish a fixed price per shipset, set applicable weight parameters and make certain other changes. The Company believes that the revised fixed pricing schedule will enable the Company to recover its engineering and development costs, provided the Company achieves specified reductions in the production costs of those items over which it has continuing responsibility.

Given the constant evolution of technology in our industry, we believe it is important to develop new products so we can continue to meet our customers needs. We continually review and evaluate technological changes affecting our industry and invest in applications-based research and development. The focus of our research and development activities will change over time based on customer needs and industry trends as well as our decisions regarding those areas where we believe we are most likely to achieve success and advance our strategic aims. Our current projects have varying risk and reward profiles. As part of our longer-term strategy, we intend to continue an ongoing program of new product development that combines internal development efforts with acquisitions and strategic alliances within spaces that are closely related to our core businesses.

In the current capital spending environment of our customers, we believe we must find ways to grow our sales  particularly in product sets that service the ongoing network evolution. To grow sales in these areas, we will seek to expand our market share and develop new sales channels. We also will look actively to expand our product breadth in existing and related markets through both strategic acquisitions and our own research and development efforts.

To grow our business further we believe we must continue to search for appropriate acquisition candidates and invest in research and development initiatives. We seek acquisitions primarily to strengthen our core product portfolio and enhance our growth initiatives in fiber, wireless and enterprise markets. In addition, we are focused on finding acquisitions that may expand the reach of our geographic sales and enhance our global operations. Because several of our largest customers are consolidating to gain greater scale and broaden their service offerings, we also believe it is appropriate for companies in our industry to consolidate in order to gain greater scale and position themselves to offer a wider array of products. We expect to fund potential acquisitions with existing cash resources, the issuance of shares of common or preferred stock, the issuance of debt or equity linked securities or through some combination of these alternatives. Our internal research and development efforts are focused on those areas where we believe we are most likely to achieve success and on projects that we believe directly advance our strategic aims. This includes a portfolio of projects with varying risk and reward profiles. We also will continue to evaluate and monitor our existing business and product lines for growth and profitability potential.

In the current environment of constrained capital spending increases by communications service providers, we believe that we must find ways to grow our sales. Our strategy is to focus more attention for growth in certain product and market segments. These product segments include next-generation core networks, FTTX, wireless capacity/coverage, network automation and enterprise network upgrades. In addition, we intend to focus more attention on emerging markets such as China and India where we believe the potential for growth is higher than in more established markets. To grow sales, we will seek to expand our market share, develop new sales channels and expand our product breadth in existing and related markets through our own research and development efforts and strategic acquisitions.

In the current environment of constrained capital spending increases by communications service providers, we believe that we must find ways to grow our sales. Our strategy is to focus more attention for growth in certain product and market segments. These product segments include next-generation core networks, FTTX, wireless capacity/coverage, network automation and enterprise network upgrades. In addition, we intend to focus more attention on emerging markets such as China and India where we believe the potential for growth is higher than in more established markets. To grow sales, we will seek to expand our market share, develop new sales channels and expand our product breadth in existing and related markets through our own research and development efforts and strategic acquisitions.
research and development
Finally, to further grow our business, we continue to invest in research and development initiatives and to search for appropriate acquisition opportunities. Our internal research and development efforts are focused on those areas where we believe we are most likely to achieve success and on projects that we believe directly advance our strategic aims with a higher probability to return our investment. We seek acquisitions primarily to strengthen our core product portfolio. Our efforts are focused on opportunities within our existing markets, as well as in adjacent or related markets that will strengthen our product offerings. Our acquisition in fiscal 2005 of Fiber Optic Network Solutions Corp. (FONS), which has enhanced our FTTX offerings, is an example of this strategy. In addition, we are focused on finding acquisitions that may enhance our geographic operations. Because several of our largest customers are consolidating to gain greater scale and broaden their service offerings, we also believe it is appropriate for companies in our industry to consolidate in order to gain greater scale and position themselves to offer a wider array of products. Our attempt to merge with Andrew Corporation during fiscal 2006, which was terminated primarily over concerns regarding the ability to obtain necessary shareholder approval, was predicated on this belief. We expect to fund potential acquisitions with

We believe that our future success depends, in part, on our ability to adapt to the rapidly changing communications environment so we can maintain our significant expertise in core technologies and continue to anticipate and meet our customers needs. We continually review and evaluate technological changes affecting the communications market and invest in applications-based research and development. The focus of our research and development activities will change over time based on particular customer needs and industry trends as well as our decisions regarding those areas in which we believe we are most likely to achieve success. As part of our long-term strategy, we intend to continue an ongoing program of new product development that combines internal development efforts with acquisitions and strategic alliances relating to new products and technologies from sources outside ADC. Our expenses for internal research and development activities were $72.4 million, $71.6 million and $59.1 million, in fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. These amounts represented 5.6%, 6.3% and 8.1%, of our total revenues in each of those respective fiscal years. These percentages have decreased over time as we have become more focused on certain initiatives and as our operations became more concentrated in infrastructure products.

During fiscal 2006, our research and development activities were directed primarily at the following areas:
research and development
New product development often requires long-term forecasting of market trends, the development and implementation of new processes and technologies and substantial capital commitment. Due to the uncertainties inherent in each of these elements, there can be no assurance that any new products we develop will achieve market acceptance or be profitable. In addition, as we balance product development with our efforts to achieve sustained profitability, we are more selective in our research and development in order to focus on projects that we believe directly advance our strategic aims and have a higher probability to return our investment.

In addition, we do not know whether our products and services will meet with market acceptance or be profitable. Many of our competitors have greater engineering and product development resources than us. Although we expect to continue to invest substantial resources in product development activities, our efforts to achieve and maintain profitability will require us to be more selective and focused with our research and development expenditures. If we fail to anticipate or respond in a cost-effective and timely manner to technological developments, changes in industry standards or customer requirements, or if we have any significant delays in product development or introduction, our business, operating results and financial condition could be affected adversely.

In December 2001, we purchased Competences 66% interest in one of the joint ventures for $3.9 million in cash and assumption of approximately $16.5 million in debt owed by that joint venture, the proceeds of which were being used to fund the development of technology. In February 2002, we purchased Competences remaining interests in the other joint ventures for approximately $350,000 in cash and assumption of approximately $4.2 million in debt, the proceeds of which were used to fund the development of the technology. The debt was paid off immediately following the purchases. We recorded expense for in-process research and development projects associated with the purchase of Competences interest in these ventures in fiscal 2002 of $10.5 million. In addition, $10.3 million was allocated to developed technology, of which $5.3 million was written off prior to fiscal 2003. The remainder is being amortized over a period of seven years.

Research and development expenses were $176.4 million for fiscal 2002, representing a 36.7% decrease from $278.6 million for fiscal 2001. We believe that given the rapidly changing technology and competitive environment in the communications equipment industry, continued commitment to product development efforts will be required for us to remain competitive. Accordingly, we intend to continue to allocate substantial resources, as a percentage of our net sales, to product development for each of our operating segments.

Non-cash stock compensation expense resulted from stock options and restricted stock converted in connection with the Centigram and Broadband Access Systems acquisitions. If we had reported this non-cash stock compensation in existing operating expense categories, research and development expense and selling and administration expense would have increased by $6.4 million and $4.0 million, respectively, in fiscal 2002, by $8.7 million and $10.0 million, respectively, in fiscal 2001, and by $24.1 million and $23.0 million, respectively, in fiscal 2000.

We identify projects that do not have technological feasibility or other uses at the time of acquisition and record expense at the time of acquisition for these in-process research and development projects. Purchased in-process research and development expenses of $22.8 million in fiscal 2000 were associated with the purchase acquisitions of IBSEN Micro Structures and Centigram. Appraisals for each purchased in-process technology were determined using the income approach, discounted based on the estimated likelihood that the project ultimately will succeed.

In January 2001 and December 2001, we entered into a total of three joint ventures with Competence Research and Development Ltd., an independent company. The joint ventures were established to share development risk and capital resources associated with the ongoing development of technology used in our iAN, BroadAccess and Small Subscriber product lines. The joint ventures were successful in advancing the development of technology related to these product lines. When the joint ventures were established we held 34%, 20% and 49% interests, respectively, in the three joint venture entities. Because we did not have majority control over the joint ventures, these investments were accounted for using the equity method. Therefore, a pro rata portion of the joint ventures' profits or losses is reflected in our consolidated income statement as Other Income (Expense). In fiscal 2002 and 2001, we incurred approximately $2.6 million and $9.7 million, respectively, in equity losses related to these joint ventures.

In December 2001, we purchased Competence's 66% interest in one of the joint ventures for $3.9 million in cash and assumption of approximately $16.5 million in debt owed by that joint venture, the proceeds of which were being used to fund the development of technology. In February 2002, we purchased Competence's remaining interests in the other joint ventures for approximately $350,000 in cash and assumption of approximately $4.2 million in debt, the proceeds of which were used to fund the development of the technology. The debt was paid off immediately following the purchases. We recorded expense for in-process research and development projects associated with the purchase of Competence's interest in these ventures in fiscal 2002 of $10.5 million. In addition, $10.3 million was allocated to developed technology, which will be amortized over a period of seven years. Appraisals for

The Company conducts research and development activities internally in its Elmsford, New York facility as well as in its Verona, Italy facility, and contracts out certain projects to qualified vendors and external consultants, as needed. The Company’s research and development efforts and technologies were significantly enhanced by the acquisition of QR on April 19, 2007. The Company’s main focus is to continue to develop products that offer diagnostic treatment options that offer user comfort and are competitively priced. The Company has integrated its research and development between both locations.
research and development
The Company is subject to both foreign and domestic competition. Competitors have made significant investments in research and development of new technologies, products and services. Some competitors are well established in similar manufacturing and distribution businesses and may have greater financial, manufacturing and distribution resources than the Company. With respect to all of its products, the Company competes on the basis of function, features, product specifications, price per application, promptness of delivery and customer service. The Company purchases certain products from others for resale on a non-exclusive basis, which may be subject to competition from the suppliers or other independent distributors.
development cost
There was no write-off of In Process Research and Development Costs in Fiscal Year 2008. The write-off in Fiscal Year 2007 of $3,760,000 was related to in-process research and development that had been acquired as part of the purchase of QR. The capitalization and immediate write-off were recorded as a result of the allocation of the purchase price of QR. These charges will not have a continued impact on the Company’s future operating results.
development cost
Research and development costs increased approximately $946,700, or 92.7%, between Fiscal Year 2007 and Fiscal Year 2008. The Company’s research and development efforts and technologies were significantly enhanced by the acquisition of QR. All of this increase was due to research and development efforts in Italy, where the primary focus is on three-dimensional imaging systems. These expenses are denominated in Euros and therefore are subject to variations in the US dollar/Euro exchange rate fluctuations. The Company continues to invest in the design, development and refinement of its existing digital imaging equipment, as well as the design and development of new digital imaging equipment for the human dental and broad veterinary applications. Research and development costs may fluctuate between reporting periods, due to changing research and development consulting agreements, initiation or completion of certain project tasks, and market demands. Research and development costs may continue to increase over the next several years as the Company evaluates its strategy to develop and market additional high tech digital products. The Company has integrated its research and development between both locations.

The Company conducts research and development activities internally, at the New York facility, as well as contracts certain projects to qualified vendors and expert consultants. The Company's research and development efforts and technologies have been enhanced by business acquisitions completed in Fiscal Years 1997 and 1998. In each of these transactions, the Company added new product lines, and gained proprietary technologies and access to future research and development benefits. Commencing in April 1997, the Company participated in the development of new video/x-ray imaging sensors, including but not limited to Close Coupled Device ("CCD") and Complimentary Metal Oxide Semiconductor ("CMOS") type sensors. Research and development costs for the Fiscal Year 2000 does not include the European Union ("EU") grants paid to the Company for the Company's participation in a CMOS research and development project. All dental applications resulting from the research under the project will be licensed exclusively to the Company. The EU contract expired in May 2000. However, the Company is continuing its research and development efforts previously conducted under the EU contract, with internally generated funds.

The Company's products utilize mechanical, as well as analog and digital electronic, technologies. The Company is subject to both foreign and domestic competition. The competition is characterized by significant investment in research and development of new technologies, products and services. Some competitors are well established in the film processor manufacturing and distribution businesses and may have greater financial, distribution resources and facilities than the Company. The Company relies on internal research and development personnel as well as subcontracted vendors. With respect to all of its products, the Company competes on the basis of price, features, product quality, applications, engineering, and promptness of delivery and customer service. The Company also manufacturers and provides to OEM customers different product versions which may compete with Company supplied products to other OEM, as well as Company branded products. The Company purchases certain products from others for resale on a non-exclusive basis, which may be subject to competition from other independent distributors.

The acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method. Accordingly, a portion of the purchase price was allocated to the net assets acquired based on their estimated fair values. The Company also allocated a portion of the purchase price to in-process research and development expenditures, which reduced fiscal 1998 operating income by $1.7 million. Such allocation was recorded based on a third party appraisal of the value of the in-process research and development projects acquired as of the acquisition date. The balance of the purchase price was recorded as the excess of cost over net assets acquired ("goodwill"). As discussed in Note 9, no goodwill resulting from this acquisition remains as of June 30, 1999 due to the purchase price adjustment discussed above and the write-off of $1.3 million of goodwill which became impaired during 1999.

The Company's Pharmaceuticals business is actively working on the development of new pain products which, if successful, would include a technology designed to deter abuse. During the fourth quarter of 2007, Pharmaceuticals reported positive results from its Phase III double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled pivotal efficacy trial for EMBEDA, its investigational abuse deterrent extended-release morphine product. The trial of over 500 patients demonstrated that EMBEDA delivered statistically significant pain relief versus placebo. Pharmaceuticals is targeting the filing of a New Drug Application (NDA) in the first quarter of 2008 for EMBEDA. The Company expects significant research and development investment in 2008 in support of its abuse-deterrent opioid product development programs as well as investment in support for the launch and optimized commercialization of FLECTOR Patch. See "Research, Product Development and Technical Activities" and "Risk Factor - The Company's products and future products are based on technologies in areas where third parties hold numerous patents".

Another of API's main expansion initiatives is forward integration into the injectable finished product form of several of its APIs. The Company is in the process of expanding its Copenhagen facility to meet capacity requirements for this new initiative. Potential sources for additional new products are API's internal research and development, co-development projects with third parties, partnerships and in-licensing. See "Risk Factors - The Company depends on development, manufacture and marketing of new products for its future success" and "The Company could have difficulties in developing and integrating strategic alliances, co-development opportunities and other relationships".

AH's main expansion initiatives focus on new products from research and development activities, the purchase of businesses or individual products from third parties, co-development and in-licensing and expanding the geographic reach of its current product line with new registrations in new jurisdictions. See "Risk Factors - The Company depends on development, manufacture and marketing of new products for its future success" and "Risk Factors - The Company could have difficulties in developing and integrating strategic alliances, co-development opportunities and other relationships".
research and development
Research and development is important to each of the Company's continuing business segments. The Company's research, product development and technical activities in the Pharmaceuticals business are directed toward developing proprietary drug delivery systems, line extensions and new pain products with abuse deterrent technology. In addition, IDEA AG is developing the Company's licensed product ketoprofen in TRANSFERSOME gel. The Company's API business performs research and development activities on chemical synthesis, fermentation and purification technologies intended to permit the introduction of additional products. Additionally, it is in the process of developing the injectable finished product form for several of its APIs. The Company is focusing its AH product development spending on activities complementary to in-licensing and co-developing technologies through arrangements with third parties.
research and development
Most technical product development for Pharmaceuticals is conducted in its Piscataway, New Jersey site, though some technical product development in 2008 will continue to be conducted in Elizabeth, New Jersey in laboratories leased from Actavis. The Oslo, Norway and Copenhagen, Denmark facilities are used for API research and development. The Company conducts its technical product development activities for AH at its facilities in Willow Island, West Virginia, Chicago Heights, Illinois, Bridgewater, New Jersey, and contract research organizations. Independent research facilities in the U.S. and Europe are used for all business segments.
research and development
The Company, in its continuing businesses, expended approximately $140.3 million, including the $60.0 million upfront payment to IDEA, $44.4 million and $26.9 million on research and development efforts in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The Company expects its total research and development spending in 2008, including potential product licensing milestone payments (including $77 million in potential payments for ketoprofen in TRANSFERSOME gel) to be 10 to 20% higher than in 2007. Most of this spending will be for the development of Pharmaceuticals' investigational abuse-deterrent pain product platform and certain development initiatives in connection with commercializing the FLECTOR Patch. Research and development activities are inherently speculative. Investments in research and development do not always result in the successful development of a product. Accordingly, it should not be assumed that potential products in the Company's pipeline will be successfully commercialized.

Pharmaceuticals is focused primarily on the pain management market in the United States. It markets two branded pharmaceutical prescription products, a pain medication sold in the U.S. under the trademark KADIAN and a prescription topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory ("NSAID") patch product marketed in the U.S., beginning in January 2008, under the trademark FLECTOR. Both drugs are manufactured by third parties. For the year ended December 31, 2007, Pharmaceuticals had product sales, consisting solely of KADIAN, of approximately $167.7 million and an operating loss of approximately $61.5 million. Included in this loss was a research and development charge of $60 million related to the initial upfront payment to IDEA AG for the exclusive U.S. rights to ketoprofen in TRANSFERSOME gel, an NSAID in clinical development. KADIAN accounted for approximately 23% of the Company's total revenues in 2007.
research and development
Pharmaceuticals realizes significant gross profit margins on its sales of KADIAN, but competes in a highly competitive market, and is subject to potential challenges from generic equivalents. The Company's business plan includes significant investments in research and development spending to broaden its product pipeline. This includes investments associated with the development of next-generation opioid pain products which include technology designed to deter abuse and potential milestone payments to IDEA AG for ketoprofen in TRANSFERSOME gel, a prescription topical NSAID in clinical development. In connection with its January 2008 launch of the FLECTOR Patch, Pharmaceuticals has made significant investments in sales and marketing in support of an expanded sales force and promotional activities.

The Company's products are subject to regulation by governmental authorities, principally the Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") in the United States and equivalent authorities in international markets. Research and development expenses are charged to the consolidated statement of operations when incurred, as the Company considers that regulatory and other uncertainties inherent in the development of new products preclude it from capitalizing development costs.
r&d
Acquired products or projects which have not achieved technical feasibility (i.e., regulatory approval) are charged to the statement of operations on the date of acquisition. In connection with its acquisitions, the Company generally utilizes independent appraisers in the determination of IPR&D charges. The amount of this charge is determined based on a variety of factors including the estimated future cash flows of the product or project, the likelihood of future benefit from the product or project, and the level of risk associated with future research and development activities related to the product or project.

Expenditures for research and development are expensed as incurred. Property and equipment that are acquired or constructed for research and development activities and that have alternate future uses are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis. Upfront and milestone payments made to third parties in connection with agreements with third parties are generally expensed as incurred up to the point of regulatory approval, absent any alternative future uses. Payments made to third parties subsequent to regulatory approval are generally capitalized and amortized over the remaining useful life of the related product. Amounts capitalized for such payments are included in intangibles, net of accumulated amortization.

In 2007, 2006, and 2005, the Company capitalized purchased software from third-party vendors and software development costs incurred under the provisions of SOP 98-1, "Accounting for the Cost of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use". Capitalized costs include only (1) external direct costs of materials and services incurred in developing or obtaining internal use software, (2) payroll and payroll-related costs for employees who are directly associated with and who devote substantial time to the internal-use software project, and (3) interest costs incurred, while developing internal-use software. Amortization begins as portions of the projects are completed, ready for their intended purpose and placed in service.

The Company's Pharmaceuticals business is actively working on the development of a new pain product which, if successful, would include a technology designed to deter abuse. During the third quarter of 2006, Pharmaceuticals reported positive results from a Phase II efficacy and pharmacokinetic trial for the investigational abuse deterrent extended-release morphine product. The goal of the study was to demonstrate that the Company's proprietary abuse-deterrent technology for long-acting opioids does not impact the safety or efficacy of the product. This goal was achieved. Pharmaceuticals has commenced Phase III activities on this new product and, assuming a successful Phase III outcome, is targeting a New Drug Application (NDA) filing in the first half of 2008. The Company expects significant research and development investment in 2007 and 2008 in support of its abuse-deterrent opioid product development programs. See "Research, Product Development and Technical Activities" and "Risk Factors - The Company's products and future products are based on technologies in areas where third parties hold numerous patents".
research and development
The Company has several growth initiatives related to API. API has initiated a program of new product launches that began in 2005 with the launch (commercial sale of product) of tobramycin and continued with the launch of fluticasone and teicoplanin in non-regulated markets in the third quarter of 2006 and mupirocin acid in the fourth quarter of 2006. The Company intends to continue to invest in and develop its API pipeline and expects to launch two additional products before the end of 2007. In addition, in the second quarter of 2006, API reached agreement with Hisun Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., a Chinese supplier, that, subject to regulatory approvals, is expected to enable the Company to increase the manufacturing capacity of one of its current major products, vancomycin, over the next three years. During the third quarter of 2006, the Company commenced the sale of vancomycin manufactured at the Hisun facility into limited markets, and began enhancing the site's manufacturing processes in preparation for regulatory approvals. Another of API's main expansion initiatives is forward integration into the injectable finished product form of several of its APIs. The Company is in the process of expanding its Copenhagen facility to meet capacity requirements for this new initiative. Potential sources for additional new products are API's internal research and development, co-development projects with third parities, partnerships and in-licensing. See "Risk Factors -. The Company depends on development, manufacture and marketing of new products for its future success" and "The Company could have difficulties in developing and integrating strategic alliances, co-development opportunities and other relationships".

Research and development expenses, excluding Discontinued Operations, were $44.4 million, $26.9 million and $25.4 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. In 2007, the Company intends to increase its spending on research and development by approximately $30 to $35 million. Most of this increased spending will be for the development of Pharmaceuticals' investigational abuse-deterrent pain product platform. Research and development activities are inherently speculative. Investments in research and development do not always result in the successful development of a product. Accordingly, it should not be assumed that potential products in the Company's pipeline will be successfully commercialized.

Product Lines. The Company's API business markets and sells primarily 10 antibiotic APIs. APIs constitute the active substances in certain pharmaceuticals for the treatment of some skin, throat, intestinal and systemic infections. The Company is a leading producer of bacitracin, polymyxin, and vancomycin; all of which are important pharmaceutical grade antibiotics. The Company's API business also manufactures other antibiotic active substances such as tobramycin, colistin and methsulfate and colistin and amphotericin B, a parenteral grade antifungal. The primary applications for the API products are injectable and specialized topical and human surgical finished product applications. API owns European marketing authorizations for vancomycin vial and capsule finished products which are manufactured (using the Company's active substance) and distributed for the Company by third parties. The Company has initiated a program of new product launches in its API business. The program began in 2005 with the launch of Tobramycin and will continue with a planned launch of Fluticasone in non-regulated markets in the second quarter of 2006. The Company will continue to invest in and develop its API pipeline and expects to launch one or two additional products before the end of the year. Potential sources for additional new products are the API's research and development, co-development projects with third parities, partnerships and in-licensing.

Success in the generic industry depends on developing, manufacturing and marketing new products, including generic versions of products no longer subject to patent protection. The successful introduction of new products is affected by the timing of introduction. Being first to market can bring significant returns. Introducing a new product after or with a number of competitors generates significantly lower returns. During 2004, the Company launched three new products in the U.S. The number of competitors caused pricing and market share to be significantly lower than expected. The Company increased research and development spending in 2004 to increase filings with regulatory agencies and increase the number of new product introductions.

USHP's largest manufacturing facility is located in Baltimore, Maryland and is dedicated solely to the manufacture of liquid pharmaceuticals. (See "Government Regulation - Facility Compliance".) The Company's facility in Lincolnton, North Carolina manufactures creams, ointments and suppositories. As a result of the Faulding Acquisition, the Company acquired Purepac's oral solid dose facility in Elizabeth, New Jersey, which manufactures tablets and capsules, and a new facility in Piscataway, New Jersey.

(until June 2003) and a third party facility. In June of 2003, the blending of Deccox was moved to the Company's Chicago Heights facility. Product research and development is done at AH's Chicago Heights, Willow Island and Oslo facilities. The Company manufactures its fish vaccine products at its Overhalla, Norway facility and third party facilities and utilizes contract manufacturing to provide certain raw materials for vaccine production. The Company has closed its facilities at Hannibal, Missouri, Lowell, Arkansas, Parkville, Australia, and its research and development facility in Wrightstown, New Jersey. Products currently produced at these facilities will be supplied by other Company facilities or third parties where required. The Wrightstown facility was sold during 2003.
research and development
Scientific development is important to each of the Company's business segments. The Company's research, product development and technical activities in the human generic pharmaceuticals business, which is mainly performed within the U.S., concentrate on the development of generic equivalents of established patented products, as well as discovering novel treatment uses of existing drugs. Such research, product development and technical activities also focus on developing proprietary drug delivery systems, patent circumvention in the U.S. and on improving existing delivery systems, packaging and manufacturing techniques. The Company's API business performs research and development activities on chemical synthesis, fermentation and purification technologies in Norway and Denmark.
research and development
The Company's research and development capabilities have been enhanced and broadened as a result of the Faulding Acquisition, strengthening its ability to introduce new products and its expertise in the area of extended release products and the formulation and manufacture of oral solid dose products. In view of the substantial funds that are generally required to develop new chemical drug entities, the Company does not anticipate undertaking significant activities in this area.
research and development
The Company's technical development activities for animal pharmaceuticals previously involved extensive product development and testing for the primary purpose of establishing clinical support for new products and additional uses for variations of existing products and seeking related FDA and other governmental approvals. The Company focused its AH product development spending in 2003 on activities such as in-licensing and co-developing technologies through arrangements with third parties as well as on its own research and development of vaccines for farmed fish, and will continue this focus in 2004.
research and development
Given the Company's global presence and its focus on research and development, the Company seeks to:
research and development
shorten product development cycles for introduction and approval of similar products across geographic markets through the exchange of knowledge across its global research and development efforts; and
research and development
capitalize on the globalized human pharmaceutical research and development function in order to be more efficient in the scope of research activities, including the distribution of research and development, manufacturing and purchasing costs across a global platform.
research and development
Generally, research and development activities are conducted on a business segment basis.
research and development
The Company conducts its technical product development activities for Animal Health at its facilities in Oslo, Norway; Willow Island, West Virginia; and Chicago Heights, Illinois. The technical product development for finished Human Pharmaceuticals products is conducted in Elizabeth, New Jersey, and Baltimore, Maryland. The Oslo, Norway and Copenhagen, Denmark facilities are used for API research and development. Independent research facilities in the U.S. and Europe are used for each of the business segments. The Company closed its finished product research and development operations in Copenhagen, Denmark in 2001. The Company

Research and development expenses, the majority of which was expended for Human Pharmaceuticals (which exclude legal fees), were approximately $63.2 million, $67.1 million and $86.7 million in 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively. The 2001 expenses include a charge for purchased in-process research and development of $37.7 million related to the Faulding Acquisition.
research and development
Research and development activities are inherently speculative. Investments in research and development do not always result in the successful development of a product. For example, the Company sometimes withdraws or abandons its pending ANDAs, particularly if the product is approved after generic market formation. Accordingly, it should not be assumed that potential products in the Company's pipeline will be successfully commercialized.
research and development
Research and development expenditures will negatively impact the Company's earnings in the short term, and there is no guarantee of success.
research and development
The Company expects to significantly increase its expenditures on research and development efforts. As a result, these research and development expenditures may have an adverse impact on the Company's earnings in the short term. Further, the Company cannot be sure that its research and development expenditures will, in the long term, result in the commercialization of products which prove to be economically successful.

Success in the generic industry depends on developing, manufacturing and marketing new products, including generic versions of products no longer subject to patent protection. The successful introduction of new products is affected by the timing of introduction. Being first to market brings significant returns. Introducing a new product after or with a number of competitors generates significantly lower returns. The Company plans to increase research and development spending in 2004 to increase filings with regulatory agencies and increase the number of new product introductions.
research and development
In July, the Company agreed to acquire the OPB for $660.0 million (approximately $700.0 million including direct acquisition related costs and financing costs). The acquisition closed in December and resulted in significant required charges including a $37.7 million charge for in-process research and development.
r&d
Research and Development Expense ("R&D")
r&d
Research and development expenses decreased $3.9 million in 2003 due to the timing of clinical studies, mainly by USHP and planned reductions by AH. Remediation efforts by USHP personnel has also lowered R&D by shifting resources to corrective actions.
r&d
On a consolidated basis, R&D expense increased $18.1 million. The increase is primarily attributable to the inclusion of OPB operations.
r&d
Purchased in-Process R&D
r&d
In connection with the 2001 purchase of the OPB, the Company expensed $37.7 million of in-process R&D.
r&d
In-Process R&D
r&d
The provision (benefit) for income taxes in 2002 as a percentage of pre-tax income was approximately (40.1%) as compared to (1.5%) in 2001. The major component in 2001 which reduced the effective benefit was reduced as a result of the non-deductible write-off of in-process R&D of $37.7 million recorded in the OPB acquisition. Footnote 15 to the financial statements presents an analysis of the effective tax rate.
r&d
The OPB acquisition closed on December 12, 2001 and in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141 "Business Combinations" was accounted for by the purchase method. Required adjustments for purchase accounting included a step-up of finished goods inventory of $7.1 million of which $1.7 million was expensed as the acquired inventory was sold in December 2001. The remaining balance of $5.4 million was expensed in the first quarter of 2002. The most significant adjustment required by purchase accounting was the valuation and write-off of in-process research and development ("IPR&D"). IPR&D was valued at $37.7 million and was written off without a tax benefit (as required) resulting in a reduction of EPS of $.92. IPR&D was valued based on forecasted after tax cash flows for each potential R&D product adjusted for charges for core technology and use of existing assets. The resultant cash flows were discounted at 15.4% and subsequently reduced for a risk adjustment factor dependent on the probability of achieving the cash flows and, in certain instances, the favorable outcome of litigation.
r&d
Research and Development ("R&D"), Including In-Process R&D ("IPR&D")
development cost
The Company's products are subject to regulation by governmental authorities, principally the Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") in the United States and equivalent authorities in international markets. Research and development expenses are charged to the consolidated statement of operations when incurred, as the Company considers that regulatory and other uncertainties inherent in the development of new products preclude it from capitalizing development costs.
r&d
Acquired products or projects which have not achieved technical feasibility (i.e., regulatory approval) are charged to the statement of operations on the date of acquisition. In connection with its acquisitions, the Company generally utilizes independent appraisers in the determination of IPR&D charges. The amount of this charge is determined based on a variety of factors including the estimated future cash flows of the product or project, the likelihood of future benefit from the product or project, and the level of risk associated with future research and development activities related to the product or project.
r&d
Cash flow from operations in 2003 was $157.0 million compared to $162.2 million and $119.4 million in 2002 and 2001, respectively. 2003 cash flows reflect net income of $13.8 million, non-cash expenses for depreciation, amortization and interest accretion totaling $105.3 million. Cash flow from operations in 2003 was negatively impacted by $22.2 million in debt placement fees paid in connection with the issuance of Senior Notes in the second quarter. Better working capital management and other items make up the balance of the cash provided by operating activities in 2003. 2002 cash flows reflected the generally non-cash nature of charges incurred in 2002. Both the asset write-downs and the debt reduction required substantial non-cash charges. 2001 cash flow reflected the non-cash nature of a number of items which contributed to the net loss for the year. The $37.7 million IPR&D charge, the inventory write-offs of $17.8 million, and the $7.4 million charge on exchange of the convertible debentures for Class A common stock are significant non-cash charges. In 2003, accounts receivable balances increased $12.4 million, net of foreign currency, compared to 2002. This resulted in an increase in days sales outstanding of approximately 68 days in 2003 versus 63 days in 2002, principally due to the geographic mix of business. Since 2002, the Company has emphasized accounts receivable management company-wide. This emphasis has generally yielded positive results, although not all customers follow stated terms and disputes can slow collection. The Company reduced accounts receivable balances in 2002 and 2001 compared to the preceding years by $27.3 million and $26.6 million, respectively. The change in marketing strategy in AH, which reduced the use of sales incentives including terms, in the fourth quarter of 2001 resulted in approximately $17 million of the 2002 decline. The emphasis on accounts receivable management, mentioned above, also contributed to these declines.

development cost
In 2003, 2002 and 2001, the Company capitalized purchased software from a third party vendor and software development costs incurred under the provisions of SOP 98-1, "Accounting for the Cost of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use". Capitalized costs include only (1) external direct costs of materials and services incurred in developing or obtaining internal use software, (2) payroll and payroll-related costs for employees who are directly associated with and who devote substantial time to the internal-use software project, and (3) interest costs incurred, while developing internal-use software. Amortization began in April 2002 as portions of the project were completed, were ready for their intended purpose and were placed in service.
development cost
Research and development costs, business process re-engineering costs, training and computer software maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. Software development costs are being amortized using the straight-line method over the expected life of the product which is estimated to be five to seven years depending on when it is placed in service.
r&d
The transaction generated significant charges for in-process research and development ("IPR&D"), the write-up and subsequent write-off of purchased inventory, financing costs specific to the transaction and integration costs incurred in combining OPB in the United States with the U.S. Pharmaceutical Division ("USPD") to form U.S. Human Pharmaceuticals ("USHP"). IPR&D was valued based on estimated future cash flows for 22 individual products under development, adjusted for charges for core technology and use of existing assets. Cash flows were discounted at a rate of 15.4% and a risk adjustment factor was subsequently applied to each project based on probability of realization of the cash flows. Cash inflows from individual projects are expected to commence during the period ranging from mid-2002 to 2005, depending on the project. The estimated future cash flows are based on assumptions consistent with the OPB's historical performance. The charges can be summarized as follows:

Research and development expenses, the majority of which was expended for Human Pharmaceuticals (which exclude legal fees), were approximately $63.2 million, $67.1 million and $86.7 million in 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively. The 2001 expenses include a charge for purchased in-process research and development of $37.7 million related to the Faulding Acquisition.
research and development
Research and development activities are inherently speculative. Investments in research and development do not always result in the successful development of a product. For example, the Company sometimes withdraws or abandons its pending ANDAs, particularly if the product is approved after generic market formation. Accordingly, it should not be assumed that potential products in the Company's pipeline will be successfully commercialized.

Research and development expenditures will negatively impact the Company's earnings in the short term, and there is no guarantee of success.
research and development
The Company expects to significantly increase its expenditures on research and development efforts. As a result, these research and development expenditures may have an adverse impact on the Company's earnings in the short term. Further, the Company cannot be sure that its research and development expenditures will, in the long term, result in the commercialization of products which prove to be economically successful.

Success in the generic industry depends on developing, manufacturing and marketing new products, including generic versions of products no longer subject to patent protection. The successful introduction of new products is affected by the timing of introduction. Being first to market brings significant returns. Introducing a new product after or with a number of competitors generates significantly lower returns. The Company plans to increase research and development spending in 2004 to increase filings with regulatory agencies and increase the number of new product introductions.

In July, the Company agreed to acquire the OPB for $660.0 million (approximately $700.0 million including direct acquisition related costs and financing costs). The acquisition closed in December and resulted in significant required charges including a $37.7 million charge for in-process research and development.

Footnote 15 to the financial statements presents an analysis of the effective tax rate.
r&d
The OPB acquisition closed on December 12, 2001 and in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141 "Business Combinations" was accounted for by the purchase method. Required adjustments for purchase accounting included a step-up of finished goods inventory of $7.1 million of which $1.7 million was expensed as the acquired inventory was sold in December 2001. The remaining balance of $5.4 million was expensed in the first quarter of 2002. The most significant adjustment required by purchase accounting was the valuation and write-off of in-process research and development ("IPR&D"). IPR&D was valued at $37.7 million and was written off without a tax benefit (as required) resulting in a reduction of EPS of $.92. IPR&D was valued based on forecasted after tax cash flows for each potential R&D product adjusted for charges for core technology and use of existing assets. The resultant cash flows were discounted at 15.4% and subsequently reduced for a risk adjustment factor dependent on the probability of achieving the cash flows and, in certain instances, the favorable outcome of litigation.

Research and Development ("R&D"), Including In-Process R&D ("IPR&D")
development cost
The Company's products are subject to regulation by governmental authorities, principally the Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") in the United States and equivalent authorities in international markets. Research and development expenses are charged to the consolidated statement of operations when incurred, as the Company considers that regulatory and other uncertainties inherent in the development of new products preclude it from capitalizing development costs.
r&d
Acquired products or projects which have not achieved technical feasibility (i.e., regulatory approval) are charged to the statement of operations on the date of acquisition. In connection with its acquisitions, the Company generally utilizes independent appraisers in the determination of IPR&D charges. The amount of this charge is determined based on a variety of factors including the estimated future cash flows of the product or project, the likelihood of future benefit from the product or project, and the level of risk associated with future research and development activities related to the product or project.
r&d
Cash flow from operations in 2003 was $157.0 million compared to $162.2 million and $119.4 million in 2002 and 2001, respectively. 2003 cash flows reflect net income of $16.9 million, non-cash expenses for depreciation, amortization and interest accretion totaling $105.3 million. Cash flow from operations in 2003 was negatively impacted by $22.2 million in debt placement fees paid in connection with the issuance of Senior Notes in the second quarter. Better working capital management and other items make up the balance of the cash provided by operating activities in 2003. 2002 cash flows reflected the generally non-cash nature of charges incurred in 2002. Both the asset write-downs and the debt reduction required substantial non-cash charges. 2001 cash flow reflected the non-cash nature of a number of items which contributed to the net loss for the year. The $37.7 million IPR&D charge, the inventory write-offs of $17.8 million, and the $7.4 million charge on exchange of the convertible debentures for Class A common stock are significant non-cash charges. In 2003, accounts receivable balances increased $12.4 million, net of foreign currency, compared to 2002. This resulted in an increase in days sales outstanding of approximately 68 days in 2003 versus 63 days in 2002, principally due to the geographic mix of business. Since 2002, the Company has emphasized accounts receivable management company-wide. This emphasis has generally yielded positive results, although not all customers follow stated terms and disputes can slow collection. The Company reduced accounts receivable balances in 2002 and 2001 compared to the preceding years by $27.3 million and $26.6 million, respectively. The change in marketing strategy in AH, which reduced the use of sales incentives including terms, in the fourth quarter of 2001 resulted in approximately $17 million of the 2002 decline. The emphasis on accounts receivable management, mentioned above, also contributed to these declines.

In 2003, 2002 and 2001, the Company capitalized purchased software from a third party vendor and software development costs incurred under the provisions of SOP 98-1, "Accounting for the Cost of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use". Capitalized costs include only (1) external direct costs of materials and services incurred in developing or obtaining internal use software, (2) payroll and payroll-related costs for employees who are directly associated with and who devote substantial time to the internal-use software project, and (3) interest costs incurred, while developing internal-use software. Amortization began in April 2002 as portions of the project were completed, were ready for their intended purpose and were placed in service.
development cost
Research and development costs, business process re-engineering costs, training and computer software maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. Software development costs are being amortized using the straight-line method over the expected life of the product which is estimated to be five to seven years depending on when it is placed in service.
r&d
The transaction generated significant charges for in-process research and development ("IPR&D"), the write-up and subsequent write-off of purchased inventory, financing costs specific to the transaction and integration costs incurred in combining OPB in the United States with the U.S. Pharmaceutical Division ("USPD") to form U.S. Human Pharmaceuticals ("USHP"). IPR&D was valued based on estimated future cash flows for 22 individual products under development, adjusted for charges for core technology and use of existing assets. Cash flows were discounted at a rate of 15.4% and a risk adjustment factor was subsequently applied to each project based on probability of realization of the cash flows. Cash inflows from individual projects are expected to commence during the period ranging from mid-2002 to 2005, depending on the project. The estimated future cash flows are based on assumptions consistent with the OPB's historical performance. The charges can be summarized as follows:

Scientific development is important to each of the Company's business segments. The Company's research, product development and technical activities in the human generic pharmaceuticals business, which is mainly performed within the U.S., concentrate on the development of generic equivalents of established patented products, as well as discovering novel treatment uses of existing drugs. Such research, product development and technical activities also focus on developing proprietary drug delivery systems, patent circumvention in the U.S. and on improving existing delivery systems, packaging and manufacturing techniques. The Company's API business performs research and development activities on chemical synthesis fermentation and purification technologies in Norway and Denmark.

In 2002, 2001 and 2000, the Company capitalized purchased software from a third party vendor and software development costs incurred under the provisions of SOP 98-1, "Accounting for the Cost of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use". Capitalized costs include only (1) external direct costs of materials and services incurred in developing or obtaining internal use software, (2) payroll and payroll-related costs for employees who are directly associated with and who devote substantial time to the internal-use software project, and (3) interest costs incurred, while developing internal-use software. Amortization began in April 2002 as portions of the project were completed, were ready for their intended purpose and were placed in service.
development cost
Research and development costs, business process re-engineering costs, training and computer software maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. Software development costs are being amortized using the straight-line method over the expected life of the product which is estimated to be five to seven years depending on when it is placed in service.
r&d
The transaction generated significant charges for in-process research and development ("IPR&D"), the write-up and subsequent write-off of purchased inventory, financing costs specific to the transaction and integration costs incurred in combining OPB in the United States with the U.S. Pharmaceutical Division ("USPD") to form U.S. Human Pharmaceuticals ("USHP"). IPR&D was valued based on estimated future cash flows for 22 individual products under development, adjusted for charges for core technology and use of existing assets. Cash flows were discounted at a rate of 15.4% and a risk adjustment factor was subsequently applied to each project based on probability of realization of the cash flows. Cash inflows from individual projects are expected to commence during the period ranging from mid-2002 to 2005, depending on the project. The estimated future cash flows are based on assumptions consistent with the OPB's historical performance. The charges can be summarized as follows:

As a result of the Acquisition, the Company has expanded its range of products and enhanced its research and development capabilities.
research and development
Facilities. USHP maintains and operates four manufacturing facilities, two research and development centers, four telemarketing facilities and two automated central distribution centers. USHP''s largest manufacturing facility is located in Baltimore, Maryland and is dedicated solely to the manufacture of liquid and nasal spray pharmaceuticals. The Company''s facility in Lincolnton, North Carolina manufactures creams, ointments and suppositories. As a result of the Acquisition, the Company acquired Purepac''s oral solid dose facility in Elizabeth, New Jersey, which manufactures tablets and capsules, and a new facility in Piscataway, New Jersey, which is in the FDA validation process for future manufacturing and which the Company anticipates will be fully functional by mid-2003. As an additional result of the Acquisition, the Company acquired a lease for a distribution center in Memphis, Tennessee, which it operates in addition to the distribution facility USHP already leased in Columbia, Maryland. USHP''s current and projected business needs do not require maintaining both distribution facilities. Therefore, the Company is devising a strategy to consolidate the distribution function in the Maryland facility. This strategy may include closing the Memphis distribution center within the next 12 months.
research and development
Facilities. The Company produces its Animal Health products in state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities. BMD is produced and blended at the Company''s Chicago Heights, Illinois facility which contains a modern fermentation and recovery plant. Albac is manufactured at the Oslo facility shared with HPI. Soluble antibiotics and vitamins are formulated in AH''s Longmont, Colorado facility and Reporcin is produced at the Company''s plant in Parkville, Australia. Feed grade chlortetracycline is produced at AH''s Hannibal, Missouri and Willow Island, West Virginia facilities in addition to being purchased from foreign suppliers. It is then blended at independent blending facilities. Bio-Cox is blended in AH''s Van Buren, Arkansas facility, and Avatec and Bovatec are blended at its Salisbury, Maryland facility. The 3-Nitro product line and Lasalocid are manufactured using the Company''s technology at separate third party facilities. These contracts require the Company to purchase minimum yearly quantities on a cost plus basis. The Company is in the process of preparing its Willow Island facility for manufacturing Lasalocid. Decoquinate, the active ingredient used in Deccox, is manufactured in accordance with a fifteen year agreement using the Company''s technology at an unrelated facility. Blending of Deccox is done at the Company''s Lowell, Arkansas plant and a third party facility. Product research and development is done at AH''s Chicago Heights, Willow Island and Oslo facilities, with an experimental farm in Wrightstown, New Jersey. The Company manufactures its fish vaccine products at its Overhalla, Norway facility and third party facilities and utilizes contract manufacturing to provide certain raw materials for vaccine production.
research and development
Scientific development is important to each of the Company''s business segments. The Company''s research, product development and technical activities in the human pharmaceuticals business within the U.S. and Norway concentrate on the development of generic equivalents of established patented products as well as discovering novel treatment uses of existing drugs. The Company''s research, product development and technical activities also focus on developing proprietary drug delivery systems, patent circumvention development in the U.S. and on improving existing delivery systems, fermentation technology and packaging and manufacturing techniques. The Company''s research and development capabilities have been enhanced and broadened as a result of the Acquisition, strengthening its ability to introduce new products and its expertise in the area of extended release products and the formulation and manufacture of oral solid dose products. In view of the substantial funds which are generally required to develop new chemical drug entities, the Company does not anticipate undertaking significant activities in this area.
research and development
Given the Company''s global presence and its focus on research and development, the Company seeks to:
research and development
reduce costs and shorten product development cycles for introduction and approval of similar products across geographic markets through the exchange of knowledge across its global research and development efforts; and
research and development
distribute its research and development, manufacturing and purchasing costs across a global platform.
research and development
Generally, research and development activities are conducted on a business segment basis. Accordingly, upon integration of the Company''s three business segments into two segments, research and development will be conducted on a two segment basis. The Company conducts its technical product development activities at its facilities in Oslo, Norway; Baltimore, Maryland; Wrightstown, New Jersey; Willow Island, West Virginia; Chicago Heights, Illinois and Elizabeth, New Jersey, as well as through independent research facilities in the U.S. and Europe. The Company closed its finished product research and development operations in Copenhagen, Denmark in 2001. However, the Copenhagen facility continues to be used for API research and development.
research and development
Research and development expenses were approximately $86.7 million, $43.3 million, and $40.2 million in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The 2001 expenses include a charge for purchased in-process research and development of $37.7 million related to the Acquisition.

In July, the Company agreed to acquire the OPB for $660.0 million (approximately $700.0 million including direct acquisition related costs and financing costs). The acquisition closed in December and resulted in significant required charges including a $37.7 million charge for in process research and development.
r&d
The OPB acquisition closed on December 12, 2001 and in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141 "Business Combinations" was accounted for by the purchase method. Required adjustments for purchase accounting included a step-up of finished goods inventory of $7.1 million of which $1.8 million was expensed as the acquired inventory was sold in December 2001. The remaining balance of $5.3 million will be expensed in the first quarter of 2002. The most significant adjustment required by purchase accounting was the valuation and write off of in-process research and development ("IPR&D"). IPR&D was valued at $37.7 million and was written off without a tax benefit (as required) resulting in a reduction of EPS of $.92. IPR&D was valued based on forecasted after tax cash flows for each potential R&D product adjusted for charges for core technology and use of existing assets. The resultant cash flows were discounted at 15.4% and subsequently reduced for a risk adjustment factor dependent on the probability of achieving the cash flows and, in certain instances, the favorable outcome of litigation.
research and development
The tax provision in 2001 was 1.8% on a pretax loss of $35.1 million due mainly to the non-deductibility of a $37.7 million in process research and development charge related to the OPB acquisition.
r&d
Research and Development ("R&D"), Including In-Process R&D ("IPR&D")
development cost
The Company's products are subject to regulation by governmental authorities, principally the Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") in the United States and equivalent authorities in international markets. Research and development expenses are charged to the consolidated statement of operations when incurred, as the Company considers that regulatory and other uncertainties inherent in the development of new products preclude it from capitalizing development costs.
r&d
Acquired products or projects which have not achieved technical feasibility (i.e., regulatory approval) are charged to the statement of operations on the date of acquisition. In connection with its acquisitions, the Company generally utilizes independent appraisers in the determination of IPR&D charges. The amount of this charge is determined based on a variety of factors including the estimated future cash flows of the product or project, the likelihood of future benefit from the product or project, and the level of risk associated with future research and development activities related to the product or project.
r&d
Cash flow from operations in 2001 was $119.4 million compared to $33.1 million and $71.6 million in 2000 and 1999, respectively. 2001 cash flow benefited from the non-cash nature of a number of items which contributed to the net loss for the year. The $37.7 million IPR&D charge, the inventory write-offs of $17.8 million, and the $7.4 million charge on exchange of the convertible debentures for Class A common stock are significant non-cash charges. Additionally, the Company reduced accounts receivable balances compared to 2000 by $26.6 million. The change in marketing strategy in AH in the 4

Operating expenses increased $56.5 million and represented 34.2% of revenues in 1999 compared to 31.4% in 1998. A major portion of the increase is attributable to the 1998 and 1999 acquisitions which include operating expenses and amortization of intangible assets acquired. Other increases included professional and consulting fees for litigation and administrative actions to attempt to reverse the European Union ban on bacitracin zinc, consulting expenses for information technology and acquisitions, expenses related to the closing of the AAHD facility in Bellevue, Washington, and increases in compensation including severance related to management changes and incentive programs. Operating expenses in 1998 include a write-off of in-process research and development of $2.1 million and $.2 million for severance related to the Cox acquisition.

Operating expenses increased by $24.1 million in 1998 on a consolidated basis. Included in 1998 operating expenses is a charge for in-process R&D of $2.1 million and IPD employee severance of $.2 million resulting from the Cox acquisition. Operating expenses in 1998 were 30.8% of revenues (31.1% including the Cox acquisition charges) compared to 32.8% of revenues in 1997. Operating expenses increased primarily due to the acquisition of Cox including goodwill amortization, increased selling and marketing expenses due to higher revenues, increased general and administrative expenses due to targeted increases in staffing and increased incentive programs offset slightly by translation of costs incurred in foreign currencies.
r&d
The provision for income taxes was 37.9% in 1998 compared to 37.3% in 1997. The slight increase in 1998 results from a 1.7% rate increase due to the write-off of in-process R&D which is not tax benefited, a .7% rate increase due to non-deductible goodwill resulting from the Cox acquisition offset partially by higher tax credits and lower statutory tax rates on foreign earnings.
