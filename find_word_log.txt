Many aspects of our operations are subject to increasingly stringent environmental regulations and concerns about climate change and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. For example, the EU has established the Emissions Trading System (ETS) to regulate GHG emissions in the EU. The EU adopted a directive in 2008 under which each EU member state is required to extend the ETS to aviation operations. However, the EU ETS has never fully been imposed, in large part due to the global effort to moderate international aviation emissions solely through the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). The EU has extended its stay on the extra-territorial application of the EU ETS as applied to international flights to/from the European Economic Area (EEA) through year-end 2023, contingent on successful implementation of CORSIA. Thereafter, the EU will assess CORSIA implementation and decide the future status of the EU ETS as applied to international aviation to/from the EEA. The U.S. enacted legislation in November 2012 intended to encourage an international solution through ICAO, but which also authorizes the U.S. Secretary of Transportation to prohibit U.S. airlines from participating in the ETS.

There is increasing global regulatory focus on climate change and GHG emissions. Efforts by the EU in 2009 to regulate flights arriving from or departing for airports outside of the EU have been postponed as members of ICAO are negotiating a global agreement on GHG emissions from the aviation sector. In 2016, ICAO passed a resolution adopting CORSIA, which is a global, market-based emissions offset program intended to encourage carbon-neutral growth beyond 2020. CORSIA was supported by the board of Airlines for America (the principal U.S. airline trade association) and IATA (the principal international airline trade association), and by American and many other U.S. and foreign airlines. In March 2017, ICAO also adopted new aircraft certification standards to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from aircraft, which will apply to new aircraft type designs in 2020, and to aircraft type designs already in production as of 2023. On June 27, 2018, ICAO adopted standards pertaining to the collection and sharing of information on international aviation emissions beginning in 2019. Airline operators must prepare GHG monitoring plans by February 2019. CORSIA will increase operating costs for American and most other airlines, including other U.S. airlines that operate internationally, but the implementation of a global program, as compared to regional emission reduction schemes, should ensure that these costs will be more evenly applied to American and its

In addition, in December 2015, at the 21st Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, over 190 countries, including the United States, reached an agreement (the Paris Agreement) to reduce GHG emissions. While the United States has since announced that it will withdraw from the Paris Agreement and there is no express reference to aviation in the Paris Agreement, to the extent countries implement the Paris Agreement or impose other climate change regulations, either with respect to the aviation industry or with respect to related industries such as the aviation fuel industry, it could have an adverse direct or indirect effect on our business.

The CORSIA will increase operating costs for American and most other airlines, including other U.S. airlines that operate internationally, but the implementation of a global program, as compared to regional emission reduction schemes, should ensure that these costs will be more predictable and more evenly applied to American and its competitors since there will be a common global regulatory regime. The CORSIA is expected to be implemented in phases, beginning in 2021. Certain details still need to be developed and the impact of the CORSIA cannot be fully predicted. While we do not anticipate any significant emissions allowance expenditures in 2018, compliance with the CORSIA or similar emissions-related requirements could significantly increase our operating costs beyond 2018. Further, the potential impact of the CORSIA or other emissions-related requirements on our costs will ultimately depend on a number of factors, including baseline emissions, the price of emission allowances or offsets and the number of future flights subject to such emissions-related requirements. These costs have not been completely defined and could fluctuate.

For example, the EU has established the Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) to regulate GHG emissions in the EU. The EU adopted a directive in 2008 under which each EU member state is required to extend the ETS to aviation operations. This directive would have required us, beginning in 2012, to annually submit emission allowances in order to operate flights to and from airports in the European Economic Area (EEA), including flights between the U.S. and EU member states. However, in an effort to allow the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) time to propose an alternate scheme to manage global aviation emissions, in April 2013, the EU suspended for one year the ETS application to flights entering and departing the EEA, limiting its application, for flights flown in 2012, to intra-EEA flights only. In October 2013, the ICAO Assembly adopted a resolution calling for the development through ICAO of a global, market-based scheme for aviation GHG emissions, to be finalized in 2016 and implemented in 2020. Subsequently, the EU has amended the EU ETS so that the monitoring, reporting and submission of allowances for aviation GHG emissions will continue to be limited to only intra-EEA flights through 2016, at which time the EU will evaluate the progress made by ICAO and determine what, if any, measures to take related to aviation GHG emissions from 2017 onwards. The U.S. enacted legislation in November 2012 which encourages the DOT to seek an international solution through ICAO and that will allow the U.S. Secretary of Transportation to prohibit U.S. airlines from participating in the ETS. The effort currently underway through ICAO to reach a global agreement on measures to manage international aviation GHG emission growth could significantly impact our business, particularly to the extent that any final agreement may emphasize a collective cost sharing approach for industry emissions growth over a cost approach based on individual carrier contribution to emission growth.

Similarly, within the U.S., there is an increasing trend toward regulating GHG emissions directly under the Clean Air Act (CAA). In response to a 2012 ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals District of Columbia Circuit requiring the EPA to make a final determination on whether aircraft GHG emissions cause or contribute to air pollution which may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare, the EPA announced in September 2014 that it is in the process of making a determination regarding aircraft GHG emissions and anticipates proposing an endangerment finding by May 2015. If the EPA makes a positive endangerment finding, the EPA is obligated under the CAA to set GHG emission standards for aircraft. Several states are also considering or have adopted initiatives to regulate emissions of GHGs, primarily through the planned development of GHG emissions inventories and/or regional GHG cap and trade programs. These regulatory efforts, both internationally and in the U.S. at the federal and state levels, are still developing, and we cannot yet determine what the final regulatory programs or their impact will be in the U.S., the EU or in other areas in which we do business.

In addition, the U.S. Congress has considered legislation on climate change. Although Congress has not passed comprehensive climate change legislation, several states have adopted mechanisms to regulate greenhouse gas emissions. Even without further federal legislation, the EPA may act to regulate greenhouse gas emissions. In 2009, the EPA issued its final Endangerment and Cause or Contribute Findings for Greenhouse Gases, which became effective in January 2010. This regulatory finding sets the foundation for potential future EPA greenhouse gas regulation under the Clean Air Act. Depending on the scope of such regulation, certain of our facilities and operations may be subject to additional operating and other permit requirements, potentially resulting in increased operating costs.

The proposal is expected to be approved by the European Parliament and EU member states represented in the EU Council in the first quarter of 2013. The ETS may be reactivated if ICAO does not make progress towards an alternate global scheme within the next year. The U.S. enacted legislation in November 2012 that will allow the Secretary of Transportation to prohibit U.S. airlines from participating in the ETS. While these measures create some uncertainty as to the extent to which we will be required to participate in the ETS going forward, it is nevertheless increasingly likely that in the future we will be required to participate in some form of international arrangement governing aircraft emissions. Although the cost of compliance with the ETS, or any alternate global scheme, is difficult to predict because certain key parameters, such as the number and price of emission allowances we may be required to purchase, are unknown, such costs could be significant.

It is currently unknown how climate change legislation or regulation, if enacted, would specifically apply to the aviation industry. However, the impact on us of any climate change legislation or regulation is likely to be adverse and related costs of compliance could be significant. Such legislation or regulation could result in, among other things, increased fuel costs, carbon taxes or fees, the imposition of requirements to purchase emission offsets or credits, increased aircraft and equipment costs, and restrictions on the growth of airline operations. We continue to evaluate ongoing climate change developments at the international, federal and state levels and assess the potential associated impacts on our business and operations.

In December 2009, the ATA, joined by American, Continental and United, filed a legal action in the United Kingdom (UK) challenging the implementation of the EU ETS as applied to aviation. The case was subsequently referred to the Court of Justice of the European Union, which in December 2011 upheld the validity of the EU ETS as applied to aviation. The case has been returned to the UK court for final disposition. We believe that non-EU governments are continuing to consider formal challenges to the EU ETS as applied to aviation. However, unless interim relief is granted, we will be required to continue to comply with the EU ETS during the pendency of any such challenges. Although the cost of compliance with the EU ETS is difficult to predict given the uncertainty of a number of variables, such as the number and price of emission allowances we may be required to purchase, such costs could be significant.

Such legislation or regulation could result in, among other things, increased fuel costs, carbon taxes or fees, the imposition of requirements to purchase emission offsets or credits, increased aircraft and equipment costs, and restrictions on the growth of airline operations. We continue to evaluate ongoing climate change developments at the international, federal and state levels and assess the potential associated impacts on our business and operations.

climate change
Many aspects of the Companys operations are subject to increasingly stringent environmental regulations. Concerns about climate change and greenhouse gas emissions, in particular, may result in the imposition of additional legislation or regulation. For example, the EU recently approved measures that impose emissions limits on airlines with operations to, from or within the EU as part of an emissions trading system beginning in 2012. The Company is continuing to assess the potential costs of the EU measures. Such legislative or regulatory action by the U.S., state or foreign governments currently or in the future may adversely affect the Companys business and financial results. See Item 1A, Risk Factors, for additional information.

Many aspects of our operations are subject to increasingly stringent environmental regulations. Concerns about climate change and greenhouse gas emissions, in particular, may result in the imposition of additional legislation or regulation. The EU has adopted a directive under which each EU member state is required to extend the existing EU emissions trading scheme (ETS) to aviation. This will require the Company to annually submit emission allowances in order to operate flights to and from EU member states in January 2012 and thereafter, including flights between the U.S. and EU member states. In December 2009, the ATA, joined by American, Continental and United, filed a legal action in the United Kingdom challenging the implementation of the EU ETS as applied to aviation. We believe that non-EU governments are also likely to consider formal challenges to the EU ETS as applied to aviation. It is not clear whether the EU ETS will withstand such challenges. However, unless interim relief is granted, we will be required to continue to comply with the EU ETS during the pendency of the legal challenges. Although the cost of compliance with the EU ETS is difficult to predict given the uncertainty of a number of variables, such as the number and price of emission allowances we may be required to purchase, such costs could be significant.

Other legislative or regulatory actions addressing climate change and emissions from aviation that may be taken in the future by the U.S., state or foreign governments or through international treaties may adversely affect our business and financial results. The United Nations International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), for

example, recently adopted a resolution identifying certain fuel efficiency goals and emission trading system principles for international aviation, which may provide a basis for such future legislative or regulatory action. Climate change legislation was previously introduced in the U.S. Congress; such legislation could be re-introduced in the future by the U.S. Congress and state legislatures, and could contain provisions affecting the aviation industry. In addition, the EPA could seek to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from aircraft. It is currently unknown how climate change legislation or regulation, if enacted, would specifically apply to the aviation industry.

Other legislative or regulatory actions addressing climate change and emissions from aviation that may be taken in the future by the U.S., state or foreign governments may adversely affect our business and financial results. Climate change legislation has been introduced in the U.S. Congress and by certain state legislatures, which include certain provisions that may affect the aviation industry. In addition, the EPA has found that greenhouse gases endanger public health and welfare. Although this finding was not applied in the context of aviation, it is possible that the EPA could in the future regulate greenhouse gas emissions from aircraft. It is currently unknown how climate change legislation or regulation, if enacted, would specifically apply to the aviation industry.

Moreover, additional laws, regulations, taxes and airport rates and charges have been enacted from time to time that have significantly increased the costs of airline operations, reduced the demand for air travel or restricted the way we can conduct our business. For example, the Aviation and Transportation Security Act, which became law in 2001, mandated the federalization of certain airport security procedures and resulted in the imposition of additional security requirements on airlines. In addition, many aspects of our operations are subject to increasingly stringent environmental regulations, and concerns about climate change, in particular, may result in the imposition of additional regulation. For example, the EU has approved a proposal that will put a cap on carbon dioxide emissions for all flights into and out of the EU effective in 2012. Laws or regulations similar to those described above or other U.S. or foreign governmental actions in the future may adversely affect our business and financial results.
