Our Cargo Systems unit was selected in June 2005 to provide cargo loading systems for the Airbus A400M Military Transport Aircraft ("A400M"). We have incurred significant engineering and development costs in connection with this program (see Note 12 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements), and we expect to incur additional development costs as the design is certified. The certification of our design for full functionality is currently scheduled for the third quarter of calendar 2014. In July 2013, we and Airbus amended the A400M contract to make changes to the Company's role and responsibilities under the program, establish a fixed price per shipset, set applicable weight parameters and make certain other changes.

We may not be able to recover our engineering and development costs, which could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition, under certain circumstances, including the following: (i) we are not able to obtain certification of the design of the system in the third quarter of calendar 2014; (ii) the A400M program experiences significant additional delivery delays or order cancellations; (iii) we fail to achieve the expected production cost reductions; (iv) we fail to deliver the items that we are now responsible for in accordance with the terms of the amended contract; or (v) the contract is further amended to change our role and responsibilities.

Our Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Management has made estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities to prepare the Consolidated Financial Statements. The most significant estimates made by management include those related to the allowance for doubtful accounts, assumptions used in assessing goodwill impairment, adjustments to reduce the value of inventories and aviation equipment on or available for lease, revenue recognition, loss accruals for aviation equipment operating leases, program development costs and assumptions used in determining pension plan obligations. Accordingly, actual results could differ materially from those estimates. The following is a summary of the accounting policies considered critical by management.

As of May 31, 2014 and 2013, we have capitalized, net of reimbursements, $139.8 million and $130.9 million, respectively, of costs associated with the engineering and development of the cargo system. Sales and related cost of sales are recognized on the units of delivery method. In determining the recoverability of the capitalized program development costs, we have made certain judgments and estimates concerning expected revenues and the cost to manufacture the A400M cargo system. Differences between actual results and our assumptions may result in our not fully recovering program development costs, which could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.

Our Cargo Systems unit was selected in June 2005 to provide cargo loading systems for the Airbus A400M Military Transport Aircraft ("A400M"). We have incurred significant engineering and development costs in connection with this program (see Note 15 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements), and we expect to incur additional costs until final design approval, which is currently scheduled for the first calendar quarter of 2014. In July 2013, we and Airbus amended the A400M contract to make changes to the Company's role and responsibilities under the program, establish a fixed price per shipset, set applicable weight parameters and make certain other changes. The Company believes that the revised fixed pricing schedule will enable the Company to recover its engineering and development costs, provided the Company achieves specified reductions in the production costs of those items over which it has continuing responsibility.

Given the constant evolution of technology in our industry, we believe it is important to develop new products so we can continue to meet our customers needs. We continually review and evaluate technological changes affecting our industry and invest in applications-based research and development. The focus of our research and development activities will change over time based on customer needs and industry trends as well as our decisions regarding those areas where we believe we are most likely to achieve success and advance our strategic aims. Our current projects have varying risk and reward profiles. As part of our longer-term strategy, we intend to continue an ongoing program of new product development that combines internal development efforts with acquisitions and strategic alliances within spaces that are closely related to our core businesses.

Research and development expenses for fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009 represented 6.0% and 6.1% of net sales, respectively. Research and development expenses increased to $69.7 million in fiscal 2010 compared to $60.1 million in fiscal 2009 due to new product development initiatives and the fact that fiscal 2009 was a shortened year. Given the rapidly changing technological and competitive environment in the communications equipment industry, continued commitment to product development efforts will be required for us to remain competitive. Accordingly, we intend to continue to allocate substantial resources, as a percentage of our net sales, to product development. Most of our research has been directed towards projects that we believe directly advance our strategic aims in segments in the marketplace that we believe are most likely to grow.

To grow our business further we believe we must continue to search for appropriate acquisition candidates and invest in research and development initiatives. We seek acquisitions primarily to strengthen our core product portfolio and enhance our growth initiatives in fiber, wireless and enterprise markets. In addition, we are focused on finding acquisitions that may expand the reach of our geographic sales and enhance our global operations. Because several of our largest customers are consolidating to gain greater scale and broaden their service offerings, we also believe it is appropriate for companies in our industry to consolidate in order to gain greater scale and position themselves to offer a wider array of products. We expect to fund potential acquisitions with existing cash resources, the issuance of shares of common or preferred stock, the issuance of debt or equity linked securities or through some combination of these alternatives. Our internal research and development efforts are focused on those areas where we believe we are most likely to achieve success and on projects that we believe directly advance our strategic aims. This includes a portfolio of projects with varying risk and reward profiles.

In the current environment of constrained capital spending increases by communications service providers, we believe that we must find ways to grow our sales. Our strategy is to focus more attention for growth in certain product and market segments. These product segments include next-generation core networks, FTTX, wireless capacity/coverage, network automation and enterprise network upgrades. In addition, we intend to focus more attention on emerging markets such as China and India where we believe the potential for growth is higher than in more established markets. To grow sales, we will seek to expand our market share, develop new sales channels and expand our product breadth in existing and related markets through our own research and development efforts and strategic acquisitions.

In the FONS transaction, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of FONS in exchange for cash of $166.1 million (net of cash acquired) and certain assumed liabilities. Of the purchase price, $34.0 million is held in escrow for up to two years following closing to address potential indemnification claims. As of October 31, 2006, no claims had been made. In addition, we placed $6.7 million into a trust account to be paid to FONS employees as a retention payment over the course of the nine months following the closing of the transaction. The last retention payment associated with this acquisition was made in May 2006. We acquired $83.3 million of intangible assets as part of the purchase. Of this amount, $3.3 million was allocated to in-process research and development for new technology development, which was immediately written-off.

research and development
In the current environment of constrained capital spending increases by communications service providers, we believe that we must find ways to grow our sales. Our strategy is to focus more attention for growth in certain product and market segments. These product segments include next-generation core networks, FTTX, wireless capacity/coverage, network automation and enterprise network upgrades. In addition, we intend to focus more attention on emerging markets such as China and India where we believe the potential for growth is higher than in more established markets. To grow sales, we will seek to expand our market share, develop new sales channels and expand our product breadth in existing and related markets through our own research and development efforts and strategic acquisitions.
research and development
Finally, to further grow our business, we continue to invest in research and development initiatives and to search for appropriate acquisition opportunities. Our internal research and development efforts are focused on those areas where we believe we are most likely to achieve success and on projects that we believe directly advance our strategic aims with a higher probability to return our investment. We seek acquisitions primarily to strengthen our core product portfolio. Our efforts are focused on opportunities within our existing markets, as well as in adjacent or related markets that will strengthen our product offerings. Our acquisition in fiscal 2005 of Fiber Optic Network Solutions Corp. (FONS), which has enhanced our FTTX offerings, is an example of this strategy. In addition, we are focused on finding acquisitions that may enhance our geographic operations. Because several of our largest customers are consolidating to gain greater scale and broaden their service offerings, we also believe it is appropriate for companies in our industry to consolidate in order to gain greater scale and position themselves to offer a wider array of products. Our attempt to merge with Andrew Corporation during fiscal 2006, which was terminated primarily over concerns regarding the ability to obtain necessary shareholder approval, was predicated on this belief. We expect to fund potential acquisitions with

We believe that our future success depends, in part, on our ability to adapt to the rapidly changing communications environment so we can maintain our significant expertise in core technologies and continue to anticipate and meet our customers needs. We continually review and evaluate technological changes affecting the communications market and invest in applications-based research and development. The focus of our research and development activities will change over time based on particular customer needs and industry trends as well as our decisions regarding those areas in which we believe we are most likely to achieve success. As part of our long-term strategy, we intend to continue an ongoing program of new product development that combines internal development efforts with acquisitions and strategic alliances relating to new products and technologies from sources outside ADC. Our expenses for internal research and development activities were $72.4 million, $71.6 million and $59.1 million, in fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. These amounts represented 5.6%, 6.3% and 8.1%, of our total revenues in each of those respective fiscal years. These percentages have decreased over time as we have become more focused on certain initiatives and as our operations became more concentrated in infrastructure products.

During fiscal 2006, our research and development activities were directed primarily at the following areas:
research and development
New product development often requires long-term forecasting of market trends, the development and implementation of new processes and technologies and substantial capital commitment. Due to the uncertainties inherent in each of these elements, there can be no assurance that any new products we develop will achieve market acceptance or be profitable. In addition, as we balance product development with our efforts to achieve sustained profitability, we are more selective in our research and development in order to focus on projects that we believe directly advance our strategic aims and have a higher probability to return our investment.

We may not predict technological trends or the success of new products in the communications equipment market accurately. New product development often requires long-term forecasting of market trends, development and implementation of new technologies and processes and a substantial capital commitment. In addition, we do not know whether our products and services will meet with market acceptance or be profitable. Many of our competitors have greater engineering and product development resources than us. Although we expect to continue to invest substantial resources in product development activities, our efforts to achieve and maintain profitability will require us to be more selective and focused with our research and development expenditures. If we fail to anticipate or respond in a cost-effective and timely manner to technological developments, changes in industry standards or customer requirements, or if we have any significant delays in product development or introduction, our business, operating results and financial condition could be affected adversely.

The joint ventures were successful in advancing the
research and development
In December 2001, we purchased Competences 66% interest in one of the joint ventures for $3.9 million in cash and assumption of approximately $16.5 million in debt owed by that joint venture, the proceeds of which were being used to fund the development of technology. In February 2002, we purchased Competences remaining interests in the other joint ventures for approximately $350,000 in cash and assumption of approximately $4.2 million in debt, the proceeds of which were used to fund the development of the technology. The debt was paid off immediately following the purchases. We recorded expense for in-process research and development projects associated with the purchase of Competences interest in these ventures in fiscal 2002 of $10.5 million. In addition, $10.3 million was allocated to developed technology, of which $5.3 million was written off prior to fiscal 2003. The remainder is being amortized over a period of seven years. Appraisals for purchased in-process and developed technology were determined using the income approach, discounted based on the estimated likelihood that the project ultimately will succeed.

compensation expense recorded in fiscal 2001 relating to the Centigram acquisition was $6.0 million. These options were cancelled shortly after the divestiture of Centigram on October 31, 2001. Further non-cash stock compensation expense of $0.9 million, $10.4 million and $12.7 million was recognized in fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively, as a result of unvested stock options and restricted stock converted into ADC awards in connection with our fiscal 2000 acquisition of Broadband Access Systems. The exercise prices on the date of grant were deemed to be less than the estimated fair values of the awards. Expense is being recognized over the anticipated vesting period of the awards through fiscal 2005. Such amounts are reflected in research and development and selling and administration expense in the consolidated statements of operations.

The joint ventures were successful in advancing the development of technology related to these product lines. When the joint ventures were established we held 34%, 20% and 49% interests, respectively, in the three joint venture entities. Because we did not have majority control over the joint ventures, these investments were accounted for using the equity method. Therefore, a pro rata portion of the joint ventures' profits or losses is reflected in our consolidated income statement as Other Income (Expense). In fiscal 2002 and 2001, we incurred approximately $2.6 million and $9.7 million, respectively, in equity losses related to these joint ventures.

The Company conducts research and development activities internally in its Elmsford, New York facility as well as in its Verona, Italy facility, and contracts out certain projects to qualified vendors and external consultants, as needed. The Company’s research and development efforts and technologies were significantly enhanced by the acquisition of QR on April 19, 2007. The Company’s main focus is to continue to develop products that offer diagnostic treatment options that offer user comfort and are competitively priced. The Company has integrated its research and development between both locations.
research and development
The Company is subject to both foreign and domestic competition. Competitors have made significant investments in research and development of new technologies, products and services. Some competitors are well established in similar manufacturing and distribution businesses and may have greater financial, manufacturing and distribution resources than the Company. With respect to all of its products, the Company competes on the basis of function, features, product specifications, price per application, promptness of delivery and customer service. The Company purchases certain products from others for resale on a non-exclusive basis, which may be subject to competition from the suppliers or other independent distributors.

There was no write-off of In Process Research and Development Costs in Fiscal Year 2008. The write-off in Fiscal Year 2007 of $3,760,000 was related to in-process research and development that had been acquired as part of the purchase of QR. The capitalization and immediate write-off were recorded as a result of the allocation of the purchase price of QR. These charges will not have a continued impact on the Company’s future operating results.

Research and development costs increased approximately $946,700, or 92.7%, between Fiscal Year 2007 and Fiscal Year 2008. The Company’s research and development efforts and technologies were significantly enhanced by the acquisition of QR. All of this increase was due to research and development efforts in Italy, where the primary focus is on three-dimensional imaging systems. These expenses are denominated in Euros and therefore are subject to variations in the US dollar/Euro exchange rate fluctuations. The Company continues to invest in the design, development and refinement of its existing digital imaging equipment, as well as the design and development of new digital imaging equipment for the human dental and broad veterinary applications. Research and development costs may fluctuate between reporting periods, due to changing research and development consulting agreements, initiation or completion of certain project tasks, and market demands. Research and development costs may continue to increase over the next several years as the Company evaluates its strategy to develop and market additional high tech digital products. The Company has integrated its research and development between both locations.

The acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method. Accordingly, a portion of the purchase price was allocated to the net assets acquired based on their estimated fair values. The Company also allocated a portion of the purchase price to in-process research and development expenditures, which reduced fiscal 1998 operating income by $1.7 million. Such allocation was recorded based on a third party appraisal of the value of the in-process research and development projects acquired as of the acquisition date. The balance of the purchase price was recorded as the excess of cost over net assets acquired ("goodwill"). As discussed in Note 9, no goodwill resulting from this acquisition remains as of June 30, 1999 due to the purchase price adjustment discussed above and the write-off of $1.3 million of goodwill which became impaired during 1999.

The Company's Pharmaceuticals business is actively working on the development of new pain products which, if successful, would include a technology designed to deter abuse. During the fourth quarter of 2007, Pharmaceuticals reported positive results from its Phase III double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled pivotal efficacy trial for EMBEDA, its investigational abuse deterrent extended-release morphine product. The trial of over 500 patients demonstrated that EMBEDA delivered statistically significant pain relief versus placebo. Pharmaceuticals is targeting the filing of a New Drug Application (NDA) in the first quarter of 2008 for EMBEDA. The Company expects significant research and development investment in 2008 in support of its abuse-deterrent opioid product development programs as well as investment in support for the launch and optimized commercialization of FLECTOR Patch. See "Research, Product Development and Technical Activities" and "Risk Factor - The Company's products and future products are based on technologies in areas where third parties hold numerous patents".

Another of API's main expansion initiatives is forward integration into the injectable finished product form of several of its APIs. The Company is in the process of expanding its Copenhagen facility to meet capacity requirements for this new initiative. Potential sources for additional new products are API's internal research and development, co-development projects with third parties, partnerships and in-licensing. See "Risk Factors - The Company depends on development, manufacture and marketing of new products for its future success" and "The Company could have difficulties in developing and integrating strategic alliances, co-development opportunities and other relationships".

research and development
Research and development is important to each of the Company's continuing business segments. The Company's research, product development and technical activities in the Pharmaceuticals business are directed toward developing proprietary drug delivery systems, line extensions and new pain products with abuse deterrent technology. In addition, IDEA AG is developing the Company's licensed product ketoprofen in TRANSFERSOME gel. The Company's API business performs research and development activities on chemical synthesis, fermentation and purification technologies intended to permit the introduction of additional products. Additionally, it is in the process of developing the injectable finished product form for several of its APIs. The Company is focusing its AH product development spending on activities complementary to in-licensing and co-developing technologies through arrangements with third parties.
research and development
Most technical product development for Pharmaceuticals is conducted in its Piscataway, New Jersey site, though some technical product development in 2008 will continue to be conducted in Elizabeth, New Jersey in laboratories leased from Actavis. The Oslo, Norway and Copenhagen, Denmark facilities are used for API research and development. The Company conducts its technical product development activities for AH at its facilities in Willow Island, West Virginia, Chicago Heights, Illinois, Bridgewater, New Jersey, and contract research organizations. Independent research facilities in the U.S. and Europe are used for all business segments.
research and development
The Company, in its continuing businesses, expended approximately $140.3 million, including the $60.0 million upfront payment to IDEA, $44.4 million and $26.9 million on research and development efforts in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The Company expects its total research and development spending in 2008, including potential product licensing milestone payments (including $77 million in potential payments for ketoprofen in TRANSFERSOME gel) to be 10 to 20% higher than in 2007. Most of this spending will be for the development of Pharmaceuticals' investigational abuse-deterrent pain product platform and certain development initiatives in connection with commercializing the FLECTOR Patch. Research and development activities are inherently speculative. Investments in research and development do not always result in the successful development of a product. Accordingly, it should not be assumed that potential products in the Company's pipeline will be successfully commercialized.

Pharmaceuticals is focused primarily on the pain management market in the United States. It markets two branded pharmaceutical prescription products, a pain medication sold in the U.S. under the trademark KADIAN and a prescription topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory ("NSAID") patch product marketed in the U.S., beginning in January 2008, under the trademark FLECTOR. Both drugs are manufactured by third parties. For the year ended December 31, 2007, Pharmaceuticals had product sales, consisting solely of KADIAN, of approximately $167.7 million and an operating loss of approximately $61.5 million. Included in this loss was a research and development charge of $60 million related to the initial upfront payment to IDEA AG for the exclusive U.S. rights to ketoprofen in TRANSFERSOME gel, an NSAID in clinical development. KADIAN accounted for approximately 23% of the Company's total revenues in 2007.

Pharmaceuticals realizes significant gross profit margins on its sales of KADIAN, but competes in a highly competitive market, and is subject to potential challenges from generic equivalents. The Company's business plan includes significant investments in research and development spending to broaden its product pipeline. This includes investments associated with the development of next-generation opioid pain products which include technology designed to deter abuse and potential milestone payments to IDEA AG for ketoprofen in TRANSFERSOME gel, a prescription topical NSAID in clinical development. In connection with its January 2008 launch of the FLECTOR Patch, Pharmaceuticals has made significant investments in sales and marketing in support of an expanded sales force and promotional activities.

The Company's Pharmaceuticals business is actively working on the development of a new pain product which, if successful, would include a technology designed to deter abuse. During the third quarter of 2006, Pharmaceuticals reported positive results from a Phase II efficacy and pharmacokinetic trial for the investigational abuse deterrent extended-release morphine product. The goal of the study was to demonstrate that the Company's proprietary abuse-deterrent technology for long-acting opioids does not impact the safety or efficacy of the product. This goal was achieved. Pharmaceuticals has commenced Phase III activities on this new product and, assuming a successful Phase III outcome, is targeting a New Drug Application (NDA) filing in the first half of 2008. The Company expects significant research and development investment in 2007 and 2008 in support of its abuse-deterrent opioid product development programs. See "Research, Product Development and Technical Activities" and "Risk Factors - The Company's products and future products are based on technologies in areas where third parties hold numerous patents".

The Company has several growth initiatives related to API. API has initiated a program of new product launches that began in 2005 with the launch (commercial sale of product) of tobramycin and continued with the launch of fluticasone and teicoplanin in non-regulated markets in the third quarter of 2006 and mupirocin acid in the fourth quarter of 2006. The Company intends to continue to invest in and develop its API pipeline and expects to launch two additional products before the end of 2007. In addition, in the second quarter of 2006, API reached agreement with Hisun Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., a Chinese supplier, that, subject to regulatory approvals, is expected to enable the Company to increase the manufacturing capacity of one of its current major products, vancomycin, over the next three years. During the third quarter of 2006, the Company commenced the sale of vancomycin manufactured at the Hisun facility into limited markets, and began enhancing the site's manufacturing processes in preparation for regulatory approvals. Another of API's main expansion initiatives is forward integration into the injectable finished product form of several of its APIs. The Company is in the process of expanding its Copenhagen facility to meet capacity requirements for this new initiative. Potential sources for additional new products are API's internal research and development, co-development projects with third parities, partnerships and in-licensing. See "Risk Factors -.

The Company is a leading producer of bacitracin, polymyxin, and vancomycin; all of which are important pharmaceutical grade antibiotics. The Company's API business also manufactures other antibiotic active substances such as tobramycin, colistin and methsulfate and colistin and amphotericin B, a parenteral grade antifungal. The primary applications for the API products are injectable and specialized topical and human surgical finished product applications. API owns European marketing authorizations for vancomycin vial and capsule finished products which are manufactured (using the Company's active substance) and distributed for the Company by third parties. The Company has initiated a program of new product launches in its API business. The program began in 2005 with the launch of Tobramycin and will continue with a planned launch of Fluticasone in non-regulated markets in the second quarter of 2006. The Company will continue to invest in and develop its API pipeline and expects to launch one or two additional products before the end of the year. Potential sources for additional new products are the API's research and development, co-development projects with third parities, partnerships and in-licensing. See Risk Factors - "The Company depends on development, manufacture and marketing of new products for its future success" and "The Company could have difficulties in developing and integrating strategic alliances, co-development opportunities and other relationships".

Research and development expenses, excluding Discontinued Operations, were $26.9 million, $25.4 million, and $21.8 million in 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively. In 2006, the Company intends to increase its spending on research and development to approximately $50 million. Most of this increased spending will be for the development of a next-generation pain product in the BP business. Research and development activities are inherently speculative. Investments in research and development do not always result in the successful development of a product. Accordingly, it should not be assumed that potential products in the Company's pipeline will be successfully commercialized.

BP currently markets in the U.S. one prescription pain product, KADIAN, via a dedicated sales force. The product is sole-sourced under a toll manufacturing agreement with Purepac, a former subsidiary of the Company purchased by Actavis Group hf ("Actavis") as part of its acquisition of the Company's Generics Business. BP realizes significant gross profit margins on its sales of KADIAN; but competes in a highly competitive market, and is subject to potential challenges from generic equivalents. The Company's business plan includes significant investments in research and development spending associated with the development of a next-generation pain product with abuse deterrent characteristics. BP has experienced significantly improved profitability as a result of product prescription growth driven from sales force expansion and a new marketing campaign.

Success in the generic industry depends on developing, manufacturing and marketing new products, including generic versions of products no longer subject to patent protection. The successful introduction of new products is affected by the timing of introduction. Being first to market can bring significant returns. Introducing a new product after or with a number of competitors generates significantly lower returns. During 2004, the Company launched three new products in the U.S. The number of competitors caused pricing and market share to be significantly lower than expected. The Company increased research and development spending in 2004 to increase filings with regulatory agencies and increase the number of new product introductions. In 2004, the Company filed 10 product applications in the U.S. compared to 4 in 2003. In 2005, the Company plans to file

(until June 2003) and a third party facility. In June of 2003, the blending of Deccox was moved to the Company's Chicago Heights facility. Product research and development is done at AH's Chicago Heights, Willow Island and Oslo facilities. The Company manufactures its fish vaccine products at its Overhalla, Norway facility and third party facilities and utilizes contract manufacturing to provide certain raw materials for vaccine production. The Company has closed its facilities at Hannibal, Missouri, Lowell, Arkansas, Parkville, Australia, and its research and development facility in Wrightstown, New Jersey. Products currently produced at these facilities will be supplied by other Company facilities or third parties where required. The Wrightstown facility was sold during 2003.
research and development
Scientific development is important to each of the Company's business segments. The Company's research, product development and technical activities in the human generic pharmaceuticals business, which is mainly performed within the U.S., concentrate on the development of generic equivalents of established patented products, as well as discovering novel treatment uses of existing drugs. Such research, product development and technical activities also focus on developing proprietary drug delivery systems, patent circumvention in the U.S. and on improving existing delivery systems, packaging and manufacturing techniques. The Company's API business performs research and development activities on chemical synthesis, fermentation and purification technologies in Norway and Denmark.
research and development
The Company's research and development capabilities have been enhanced and broadened as a result of the Faulding Acquisition, strengthening its ability to introduce new products and its expertise in the area of extended release products and the formulation and manufacture of oral solid dose products. In view of the substantial funds that are generally required to develop new chemical drug entities, the Company does not anticipate undertaking significant activities in this area.
research and development
The Company's technical development activities for animal pharmaceuticals previously involved extensive product development and testing for the primary purpose of establishing clinical support for new products and additional uses for variations of existing products and seeking related FDA and other governmental approvals. The Company focused its AH product development spending in 2003 on activities such as in-licensing and co-developing technologies through arrangements with third parties as well as on its own research and development of vaccines for farmed fish, and will continue this focus in 2004.
research and development
Given the Company's global presence and its focus on research and development, the Company seeks to:
research and development
shorten product development cycles for introduction and approval of similar products across geographic markets through the exchange of knowledge across its global research and development efforts; and
research and development
capitalize on the globalized human pharmaceutical research and development function in order to be more efficient in the scope of research activities, including the distribution of research and development, manufacturing and purchasing costs across a global platform.
research and development
Generally, research and development activities are conducted on a business segment basis.
research and development
The Company conducts its technical product development activities for Animal Health at its facilities in Oslo, Norway; Willow Island, West Virginia; and Chicago Heights, Illinois. The technical product development for finished Human Pharmaceuticals products is conducted in Elizabeth, New Jersey, and Baltimore, Maryland. The Oslo, Norway and Copenhagen, Denmark facilities are used for API research and development. Independent research facilities in the U.S. and Europe are used for each of the business segments. The Company closed its finished product research and development operations in Copenhagen, Denmark in 2001. The Company

Research and development expenses, the majority of which was expended for Human Pharmaceuticals (which exclude legal fees), were approximately $63.2 million, $67.1 million and $86.7 million in 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively. The 2001 expenses include a charge for purchased in-process research and development of $37.7 million related to the Faulding Acquisition.
research and development
Research and development activities are inherently speculative. Investments in research and development do not always result in the successful development of a product. For example, the Company sometimes withdraws or abandons its pending ANDAs, particularly if the product is approved after generic market formation. Accordingly, it should not be assumed that potential products in the Company's pipeline will be successfully commercialized.
research and development
Research and development expenditures will negatively impact the Company's earnings in the short term, and there is no guarantee of success.
research and development
The Company expects to significantly increase its expenditures on research and development efforts. As a result, these research and development expenditures may have an adverse impact on the Company's earnings in the short term. Further, the Company cannot be sure that its research and development expenditures will, in the long term, result in the commercialization of products which prove to be economically successful.

Success in the generic industry depends on developing, manufacturing and marketing new products, including generic versions of products no longer subject to patent protection. The successful introduction of new products is affected by the timing of introduction. Being first to market brings significant returns. Introducing a new product after or with a number of competitors generates significantly lower returns. The Company plans to increase research and development spending in 2004 to increase filings with regulatory agencies and increase the number of new product introductions.

The provision (benefit) for income taxes in 2002 as a percentage of pre-tax income was approximately (40.1%) as compared to (1.5%) in 2001. The major component in 2001 which reduced the effective benefit was reduced as a result of the non-deductible write-off of in-process R&D of $37.7 million recorded in the OPB acquisition. Footnote 15 to the financial statements presents an analysis of the effective tax rate.
r&d
The OPB acquisition closed on December 12, 2001 and in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141 "Business Combinations" was accounted for by the purchase method. Required adjustments for purchase accounting included a step-up of finished goods inventory of $7.1 million of which $1.7 million was expensed as the acquired inventory was sold in December 2001. The remaining balance of $5.4 million was expensed in the first quarter of 2002. The most significant adjustment required by purchase accounting was the valuation and write-off of in-process research and development ("IPR&D"). IPR&D was valued at $37.7 million and was written off without a tax benefit (as required) resulting in a reduction of EPS of $.92. IPR&D was valued based on forecasted after tax cash flows for each potential R&D product adjusted for charges for core technology and use of existing assets. The resultant cash flows were discounted at 15.4% and subsequently reduced for a risk adjustment factor dependent on the probability of achieving the cash flows and, in certain instances, the favorable outcome of litigation.

Cash flow from operations in 2003 was $157.0 million compared to $162.2 million and $119.4 million in 2002 and 2001, respectively. 2003 cash flows reflect net income of $13.8 million, non-cash expenses for depreciation, amortization and interest accretion totaling $105.3 million. Cash flow from operations in 2003 was negatively impacted by $22.2 million in debt placement fees paid in connection with the issuance of Senior Notes in the second quarter. Better working capital management and other items make up the balance of the cash provided by operating activities in 2003. 2002 cash flows reflected the generally non-cash nature of charges incurred in 2002. Both the asset write-downs and the debt reduction required substantial non-cash charges. 2001 cash flow reflected the non-cash nature of a number of items which contributed to the net loss for the year. The $37.7 million IPR&D charge, the inventory write-offs of $17.8 million, and the $7.4 million charge on exchange of the convertible debentures for Class A common stock are significant non-cash charges. In 2003, accounts receivable balances increased $12.4 million, net of foreign currency, compared to 2002. This resulted in an increase in days sales outstanding of approximately 68 days in 2003 versus 63 days in 2002, principally due to the geographic mix of business. Since 2002, the Company has emphasized accounts receivable management company-wide. This emphasis has generally yielded positive results, although not all customers follow stated terms and disputes can slow collection. The Company reduced accounts receivable balances in 2002 and 2001 compared to the preceding years by $27.3 million and $26.6 million, respectively. The change in marketing strategy in AH, which reduced the use of sales incentives including terms, in the fourth quarter of 2001 resulted in approximately $17 million of the 2002 decline. The emphasis on accounts receivable management, mentioned above, also contributed to these declines.

IPR&D was valued based on estimated future cash flows for 22 individual products under development, adjusted for charges for core technology and use of existing assets. Cash flows were discounted at a rate of 15.4% and a risk adjustment factor was subsequently applied to each project based on probability of realization of the cash flows. Cash inflows from individual projects are expected to commence during the period ranging from mid-2002 to 2005, depending on the project. The estimated future cash flows are based on assumptions consistent with the OPB's historical performance. The charges can be summarized as follows:

The Human Pharmaceuticals business manufactures and markets its primary products, generic pharmaceuticals, through its IG and U.S. Human Pharmaceuticals businesses. The Human Pharmaceuticals business also markets specialty brand name pharmaceuticals in the U.S. through its Branded Pharmaceuticals unit. In addition, through API, the Human Pharmaceuticals business manufactures and markets a line of fermentation based active pharmaceutical ingredients that are used, primarily by third parties, in the manufacture of generic and branded finished pharmaceutical products. Through acquisitions, the Company has expanded its range of products and enhanced its research and development capabilities.

Facilities. USHP maintains and operates three manufacturing facilities, two research and development centers, four telemarketing facilities and one automated central distribution center. USHP's largest manufacturing facility is located in Baltimore, Maryland and is dedicated solely to the manufacture of liquid pharmaceuticals. (See "Government Regulation - Facility Compliance".) The Company's facility in Lincolnton, North Carolina manufactures creams, ointments and suppositories. As a result of the Faulding Acquisition, the Company acquired Purepac's oral solid dose facility in Elizabeth, New Jersey, which manufactures tablets and capsules, and a new facility in Piscataway, New Jersey.

(until June 2003) and a third party facility. In June of 2003, the blending of Deccox was moved to the Company's Chicago Heights facility. Product research and development is done at AH's Chicago Heights, Willow Island and Oslo facilities. The Company manufactures its fish vaccine products at its Overhalla, Norway facility and third party facilities and utilizes contract manufacturing to provide certain raw materials for vaccine production. The Company has closed its facilities at Hannibal, Missouri, Lowell, Arkansas, Parkville, Australia, and its research and development facility in Wrightstown, New Jersey. Products currently produced at these facilities will be supplied by other Company facilities or third parties where required. The Wrightstown facility was sold during 2003.
research and development
Scientific development is important to each of the Company's business segments. The Company's research, product development and technical activities in the human generic pharmaceuticals business, which is mainly performed within the U.S., concentrate on the development of generic equivalents of established patented products, as well as discovering novel treatment uses of existing drugs. Such research, product development and technical activities also focus on developing proprietary drug delivery systems, patent circumvention in the U.S. and on improving existing delivery systems, packaging and manufacturing techniques. The Company's API business performs research and development activities on chemical synthesis, fermentation and purification technologies in Norway and Denmark.
research and development
The Company's research and development capabilities have been enhanced and broadened as a result of the Faulding Acquisition, strengthening its ability to introduce new products and its expertise in the area of extended release products and the formulation and manufacture of oral solid dose products. In view of the substantial funds that are generally required to develop new chemical drug entities, the Company does not anticipate undertaking significant activities in this area.
research and development
The Company's technical development activities for animal pharmaceuticals previously involved extensive product development and testing for the primary purpose of establishing clinical support for new products and additional uses for variations of existing products and seeking related FDA and other governmental approvals. The Company focused its AH product development spending in 2003 on activities such as in-licensing and co-developing technologies through arrangements with third parties as well as on its own research and development of vaccines for farmed fish, and will continue this focus in 2004.
research and development
Given the Company's global presence and its focus on research and development, the Company seeks to:
research and development
shorten product development cycles for introduction and approval of similar products across geographic markets through the exchange of knowledge across its global research and development efforts; and
research and development
capitalize on the globalized human pharmaceutical research and development function in order to be more efficient in the scope of research activities, including the distribution of research and development, manufacturing and purchasing costs across a global platform.
research and development
Generally, research and development activities are conducted on a business segment basis.
research and development
The Company conducts its technical product development activities for Animal Health at its facilities in Oslo, Norway; Willow Island, West Virginia; and Chicago Heights, Illinois. The technical product development for finished Human Pharmaceuticals products is conducted in Elizabeth, New Jersey, and Baltimore, Maryland. The Oslo, Norway and Copenhagen, Denmark facilities are used for API research and development. Independent research facilities in the U.S. and Europe are used for each of the business segments. The Company closed its finished product research and development operations in Copenhagen, Denmark in 2001. The Company

Research and development expenses, the majority of which was expended for Human Pharmaceuticals (which exclude legal fees), were approximately $63.2 million, $67.1 million and $86.7 million in 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively. The 2001 expenses include a charge for purchased in-process research and development of $37.7 million related to the Faulding Acquisition.
research and development
Research and development activities are inherently speculative. Investments in research and development do not always result in the successful development of a product. For example, the Company sometimes withdraws or abandons its pending ANDAs, particularly if the product is approved after generic market formation. Accordingly, it should not be assumed that potential products in the Company's pipeline will be successfully commercialized.

Research and development expenditures will negatively impact the Company's earnings in the short term, and there is no guarantee of success.
research and development
The Company expects to significantly increase its expenditures on research and development efforts. As a result, these research and development expenditures may have an adverse impact on the Company's earnings in the short term. Further, the Company cannot be sure that its research and development expenditures will, in the long term, result in the commercialization of products which prove to be economically successful.

Success in the generic industry depends on developing, manufacturing and marketing new products, including generic versions of products no longer subject to patent protection. The successful introduction of new products is affected by the timing of introduction. Being first to market brings significant returns. Introducing a new product after or with a number of competitors generates significantly lower returns. The Company plans to increase research and development spending in 2004 to increase filings with regulatory agencies and increase the number of new product introductions.

The provision (benefit) for income taxes in 2002 as a percentage of pre-tax income was approximately (40.1%) as compared to (1.5%) in 2001. The major component in 2001 which reduced the effective benefit was reduced as a result of the non-deductible write-off of in-process R&D of $37.7 million recorded in the OPB acquisition. Footnote 15 to the financial statements presents an analysis of the effective tax rate.
r&d
The OPB acquisition closed on December 12, 2001 and in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141 "Business Combinations" was accounted for by the purchase method. Required adjustments for purchase accounting included a step-up of finished goods inventory of $7.1 million of which $1.7 million was expensed as the acquired inventory was sold in December 2001. The remaining balance of $5.4 million was expensed in the first quarter of 2002. The most significant adjustment required by purchase accounting was the valuation and write-off of in-process research and development ("IPR&D"). IPR&D was valued at $37.7 million and was written off without a tax benefit (as required) resulting in a reduction of EPS of $.92. IPR&D was valued based on forecasted after tax cash flows for each potential R&D product adjusted for charges for core technology and use of existing assets. The resultant cash flows were discounted at 15.4% and subsequently reduced for a risk adjustment factor dependent on the probability of achieving the cash flows and, in certain instances, the favorable outcome of litigation.

Acquired products or projects which have not achieved technical feasibility (i.e., regulatory approval) are charged to the statement of operations on the date of acquisition. In connection with its acquisitions, the Company generally utilizes independent appraisers in the determination of IPR&D charges.

Cash flow from operations in 2003 was $157.0 million compared to $162.2 million and $119.4 million in 2002 and 2001, respectively. 2003 cash flows reflect net income of $16.9 million, non-cash expenses for depreciation, amortization and interest accretion totaling $105.3 million. Cash flow from operations in 2003 was negatively impacted by $22.2 million in debt placement fees paid in connection with the issuance of Senior Notes in the second quarter. Better working capital management and other items make up the balance of the cash provided by operating activities in 2003. 2002 cash flows reflected the generally non-cash nature of charges incurred in 2002. Both the asset write-downs and the debt reduction required substantial non-cash charges. 2001 cash flow reflected the non-cash nature of a number of items which contributed to the net loss for the year. The $37.7 million IPR&D charge, the inventory write-offs of $17.8 million, and the $7.4 million charge on exchange of the convertible debentures for Class A common stock are significant non-cash charges. In 2003, accounts receivable balances increased $12.4 million, net of foreign currency, compared to 2002. This resulted in an increase in days sales outstanding of approximately 68 days in 2003 versus 63 days in 2002, principally due to the geographic mix of business. Since 2002, the Company has emphasized accounts receivable management company-wide. This emphasis has generally yielded positive results, although not all customers follow stated terms and disputes can slow collection. The Company reduced accounts receivable balances in 2002 and 2001 compared to the preceding years by $27.3 million and $26.6 million, respectively. The change in marketing strategy in AH, which reduced the use of sales incentives including terms, in the fourth quarter of 2001 resulted in approximately $17 million of the 2002 decline. The emphasis on accounts receivable management, mentioned above, also contributed to these declines.

The Human Pharmaceuticals business manufactures and markets its primary products, generic pharmaceuticals, through its International Generics and U.S. Human Pharmaceuticals businesses. The Human Pharmaceuticals business also markets specialty brand name pharmaceuticals through its U.S. Branded Pharmaceuticals business and, in certain international markets, through its Human Pharmaceuticals International business. In addition, the Human Pharmaceuticals business manufactures and markets a line of fermentation based active pharmaceutical ingredients that are used, primarily by third parties, in the manufacture of generic and branded finished pharmaceutical products. Through acquisitions, the Company has expanded its range of products and enhanced its research and development capabilities.

Facilities. USHP maintains and operates three manufacturing facilities, with a fourth facility expected to be operational during 2003, two research and development centers, four telemarketing facilities and two automated central distribution centers. USHP's largest manufacturing facility is located in Baltimore, Maryland and is dedicated solely to the manufacture of liquid and nasal spray pharmaceuticals. (See "Government Regulation - Facility Compliance".) The Company's facility in Lincolnton, North Carolina manufactures creams, ointments and suppositories. As a result of the Faulding acquisition, the Company acquired Purepac's oral solid dose facility in Elizabeth, New Jersey, which manufactures tablets and capsules, and a new facility in Piscataway, New Jersey, which is in the validation process for future manufacturing and the Company expects will begin to be utilized for manufacturing purposes during 2003. (See "Government Regulation - Facility Compliance".) The Company operates a distribution facility in Columbia, Maryland and is presently closing a similar facility in Memphis, Tennessee.
research and development
Facilities. The Company produces its Animal Health products in several manufacturing facilities. BMD is produced and blended at the Company's Chicago Heights, Illinois facility, which contains a modern fermentation and recovery plant. Albac is manufactured at the Oslo facility, which is shared with HPI. Soluble antibiotics and vitamins are formulated in AH's Longmont, Colorado facility and feed grade chlortetracycline is produced at AH's Willow Island, West Virginia facility in addition to being purchased from foreign suppliers. It is then blended at independent blending facilities. Bio-Cox is blended in AH's Van Buren, Arkansas facility, and Avatec and Bovatec are blended at its Salisbury, Maryland facility. The 3-Nitro product line is manufactured using the Company's technology at a third party facility. In 2002, the Company commenced manufacturing Lasalocid test batches at its Willow Island facility. Decoquinate, the active ingredient used in Deccox, is manufactured in accordance with an agreement that expires in 2012 using the Company's technology at a facility owned and operated by a third party. Blending of Deccox is done at the Company's Lowell, Arkansas facility (until June 2003) and a third party facility. Product research and development is done at AH's Chicago Heights, Willow Island and Oslo facilities. The Company manufactures its fish vaccine products at its Overhalla, Norway facility and third party facilities and utilizes contract manufacturing to provide certain raw materials for vaccine production. The Company has announced that it will be closing its facilities at Hannibal, Missouri, Lowell, Arkansas, Parkville, Australia, and Wrightstown, New Jersey. Products currently produced at these facilities will be supplied by other Company facilities or third parties where required.
research and development
Scientific development is important to each of the Company's business segments. The Company's research, product development and technical activities in the human generic pharmaceuticals business, which is mainly performed within the U.S., concentrate on the development of generic equivalents of established patented products, as well as discovering novel treatment uses of existing drugs. Such research, product development and technical activities also focus on developing proprietary drug delivery systems, patent circumvention in the U.S. and on improving existing delivery systems, packaging and manufacturing techniques. The Company's API business performs research and development activities on chemical synthesis fermentation and purification technologies in Norway and Denmark.
research and development
The Company's research and development capabilities have been enhanced and broadened as a result of the Faulding Acquisition, strengthening its ability to introduce new products and its expertise in the area of extended release products and the formulation and manufacture of oral solid dose products. In view of the substantial funds that are generally required to develop new chemical drug entities, the Company does not anticipate undertaking significant activities in this area.
research and development
Given the Company's global presence and its focus on research and development, the Company seeks to:
research and development
shorten product development cycles for introduction and approval of similar products across geographic markets through the exchange of knowledge across its global research and development efforts; and
research and development
capitalize on the globalized human pharmaceutical research and development function in order to be more efficient in the scope of research activities, including the distribution of research and development, manufacturing and purchasing costs across a global platform.
research and development
Generally, research and development activities are conducted on a business segment basis. Accordingly, upon integration of the Company's three business segments into two segments, research and development will be conducted on a two segment basis. The Company conducts its technical product development activities at its facilities in Oslo, Norway; Baltimore, Maryland; Willow Island, West Virginia; Chicago Heights, Illinois and Elizabeth, New Jersey, as well as through independent research facilities in the U.S. and Europe. The Copenhagen facility is used for API research and development. The Company closed its finished product research and development operations in Copenhagen, Denmark in 2001. The Company is in the process of closing its facility in Wrightstown, New Jersey.
research and development
Research and development expenses (which exclude legal fees) were approximately $67.1 million, $86.7 million and $43.3 million in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The 2001 expenses include a charge for purchased in-process research and development of $37.7 million related to the Faulding acquisition.
research and development
Research and development activities are inherently speculative. Money spent on research and development does not always result in the successful development of a product. For example, the Company sometimes withdraws or abandons its pending ANDAs, particularly if the Company determines that it was not the first company to file a paragraph IV application for the related drug. Accordingly, it should not be assumed that potential products in the Company's pipeline will be successfully commercialized.

The provision (benefit) for income taxes in 2002 as a percentage of pre-tax income was approximately (39.4%) as compared to 1.7% in 2001. The major component in 2001 which reduced the effective benefit was reduced as a result of the non-deductible write-off of in-process R&D of $37.7 million recorded in the OPB acquisition. Footnote 14 to the financial statements presents an analysis of the effective tax rate.
research and development
The tax provision in 2001 was 1.7% on a pretax loss of $35.1 million due mainly to the non-deductibility of a $37.7 million in-process research and development charge related to the OPB acquisition.
r&d
The OPB acquisition closed on December 12, 2001 and in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141 "Business Combinations" was accounted for by the purchase method. Required adjustments for purchase accounting included a step-up of finished goods inventory of $7.1 million of which $1.7 million was expensed as the acquired inventory was sold in December 2001. The remaining balance of $5.4 million was expensed in the first quarter of 2002. The most significant adjustment required by purchase accounting was the valuation and write-off of in-process research and development ("IPR&D"). IPR&D was valued at $37.7 million and was written off without a tax benefit (as required) resulting in a reduction of EPS of $.92. IPR&D was valued based on forecasted after tax cash flows for each potential R&D product adjusted for charges for core technology and use of existing assets. The resultant cash flows were discounted at 15.4% and subsequently reduced for a risk adjustment factor dependent on the probability of achieving the cash flows and, in certain instances, the favorable outcome of litigation.

Cash flow from operations in 2002 was $162.2 million compared to $119.4 million and $33.1 million in 2001 and 2000, respectively. 2002 cash flows reflected the generally non-cash nature of charges incurred in 2002. Both the asset writedowns and the debt reduction required substantial non-cash charges. 2001 cash flow reflected the non-cash nature of a number of items which contributed to the net loss for the year. The $37.7 million IPR&D charge, the inventory write-offs of $17.8 million, and the $7.4 million charge on exchange of the convertible debentures for Class A common stock are significant non-cash charges. Additionally, the Company reduced accounts receivable balances in 2002 and 2001 compared to the preceding year by $27.3 million and $26.6 million, respectively.

Operating expenses increased $56.5 million and represented 34.2% of revenues in 1999 compared to 31.4% in 1998. A major portion of the increase is attributable to the 1998 and 1999 acquisitions which include operating expenses and amortization of intangible assets acquired. Other increases included professional and consulting fees for litigation and administrative actions to attempt to reverse the European Union ban on bacitracin zinc, consulting expenses for information technology and acquisitions, expenses related to the closing of the AAHD facility in Bellevue, Washington, and increases in compensation including severance related to management changes and incentive programs. Operating expenses in 1998 include a write-off of in-process research and development of $2.1 million and $.2 million for severance related to the Cox acquisition.
r&d
The provision for income taxes was 35.1% in 1999 compared to 37.8% in 1998. The 1998 rate includes a 1.7% rate increase due to the write-off of in-process R&D which is not tax benefited.
development cost
Software and Development Costs
development cost
In 2000, the Company capitalized purchased software from a third party vendor and software development costs incurred under the provisions of SOP 98-1, "Accounting for the Cost of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use". Capitalized costs include only (1) external direct costs of materials and services consumed in developing or obtaining internal use software, (2) payroll and payroll-related costs for employees who are directly associated with and who devote substantial time to the internal-use software project, and (3) interest costs incurred, while developing internal-use software. Capitalization of such costs will cease and amortization will begin no later than the point at which the project is substantially complete and ready for its intended purpose.
development cost
Research and development costs, business process re-engineering costs, training and computer software maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. Software development costs will be amortized using the straight-line method over the expected life of the product which is estimated to be five to seven years depending on when it is placed in service.

The non-recurring charges related to the acquisition of Cox included in the second quarter of 1998 are summarized below. The charge for in-process research and development ("R&D") is not tax benefited; therefore the computed tax benefit is below the expected rate. The valuation of purchased in-process R&D was based on the cost approach for 12 generic products at varying stages of development at the acquisition date.

Operating expenses increased by $24.1 million in 1998 on a consolidated basis. Included in 1998 operating expenses is a charge for in-process R&D of $2.1 million and IPD employee severance of $.2 million resulting from the Cox acquisition. Operating expenses in 1998 were 30.8% of revenues (31.1% including the Cox acquisition charges) compared to 32.8% of revenues in 1997. Operating expenses increased primarily due to the acquisition of Cox including goodwill amortization, increased selling and marketing expenses due to higher revenues, increased general and administrative expenses due to targeted increases in staffing and increased incentive programs offset slightly by translation of costs incurred in foreign currencies.
r&d
The provision for income taxes was 37.9% in 1998 compared to 37.3% in 1997. The slight increase in 1998 results from a 1.7% rate increase due to the write-off of in-process R&D which is not tax benefited, a .7% rate increase due to non-deductible goodwill resulting from the Cox acquisition offset partially by higher tax credits and lower statutory tax rates on foreign earnings.

Included in the income tax provision calculation for 2013 is a $2.4 million tax benefit, net of related uncertain tax position reserves, for research and development income tax credits earned during 2009 through 2013. This credit was not factored in the 2012 tax provision because it was not evaluated until 2013. Along with the tax benefit of research and development income tax credits, the effective tax rate is beneficially impacted by the domestic production activities deduction, offset by nondeductible deal costs related to the Met-Pro acquisition.

We focus our development efforts on designing and introducing new and improved approaches and methodologies which for our customers produce better system performance, and often improve customer process performance. For example, the patented JET*STAR strip cooler produced by Busch International routinely allows customers to increase the speed of galvanizing lines, thus enhancing productivity, while at the same time increasing product quality by, through the use of the cooling air, holding the strip more stable as the zinc coating cools. We produce specialized products that are often tailored to the specifications of a customer or application. We continually collaborate with our customers to develop the proper solution and ensure customer satisfaction. During 2012 and 2011, costs expended on research and development were not significant. Such costs are generally included as factors in determining pricing.

Federal and state income tax expense was $4.5 million in 2012 compared to $3.4 million in 2011. The effective tax rate for 2012 was 29.3% compared to 29.0% in 2011. Included in the income tax provision calculation for 2012 is a $1.1 million tax benefit, net of related uncertain tax position reserves, for research and development income tax credits earned during 2009 through 2011. This credit was not contemplated in the 2011 tax provision because it was not identified or quantified until 2012. The Company is in the process of substantiating this credit related to the additional open years of 2009 and 2011, which is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2013 and may result in additional tax benefit to be recorded in the first quarter of 2013. Along with the tax benefit of research and development income tax credits, our effective tax rate is additionally affected by certain permanent differences including non-deductible incentive stock based compensation, reversals of certain income tax reserves/deferrals, and tax holidays in foreign jurisdictions.

In 2012, $16.8 million of cash was provided by operating activities as compared to $8.7 million provided by operating activities in 2011. The $8.1 million increase in cash flow from operating activities was primarily due to a $2.5 million increase in net income from operations, the incremental cash provided of $4.0 million in Accounts Payable and Accrued Expenses, and incremental cash provided of $1.7 million in Accrued Income Taxes. In addition, the incremental cash used of $8.4 million in Accounts Receivable was offset by the incremental cash provided of $7.1 million in Costs in Excess of Billings. The cash provided by Accounts Payable and Accrued Expenses is due to efforts to better align our vendor payment terms to our customers payment terms, recording of the first year of the Adwest earn-out, and Accrued Income Taxes. Accrued Income Taxes was benefited by the research and development tax credits discussed in Note 14 accompanying the consolidated financial statements within Item 8 of this annual report.

We are a leading global provider of radio frequency, or RF, and microwave integrated circuits, components and systems used in the design, development and maintenance of technically demanding, high-performance wireless communication systems. Our solutions include highly specialized microelectronic components and test and measurement equipment used by companies in the space, avionics, defense, commercial wireless communications, medical and other markets. We have targeted customers in these end markets because we believe our solutions address their technically demanding requirements. We were founded in 1937 and have proprietary technology that is based on the extensive know-how of our nearly 700 engineers and experienced management team, and a long history of research and development focused on specialized technologies, often in collaboration with our customers.
research and development
As technology continues to evolve and next generation communications protocols are introduced, equipment manufacturers and network providers need both test and measurement products that are compatible with the new technologies and products that work with older generation equipment. We have gained significant expertise in advanced RF and new wireless technology and have focused our research and development toward such next generation technologies. One example is the Aeroflex 3000 Series, a modular test suite for mobile phone and general purpose wireless test using the PXI standard, which is a widely accepted standard for module electronic instrumentation platforms. This product is tailored to the testing of wireless handsets and wireless base stations, which are the transmission facilities for wireless networks, where speed, repeatability, and accuracy are critical. Also, as wireless infrastructure has evolved with the advent of 4G networks, ATS has built capabilities around the two main 4G standards, which are the Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access, or WiMAX, and Long Term Evolution, or LTE, protocols. In particular, we provide the TM500 product family that targets the 4G LTE market as well as PXI-based products and the 7100 product family that target both the WiMAX and LTE markets.
research and development
The volume of mobile traffic from multiple data streams is rising rapidly and has resulted in significant technological innovation to address the increasing need for higher rates of data transmission and more efficient use of existing spectrum. This has led to the development of a number of advanced data transmission systems and technologies that use RF, microwave and millimeter wave frequencies that are being used in a broad range of end markets, including space, avionics, defense, commercial wireless communications, medical and other markets. The growing number of applications in these markets, including data transmission, video transmission, control of unmanned aerial vehicles, or UAVs, and a growing number of satellites, generally are driving increased demand for RF, microwave and millimeter wave technologies. Additionally, the creation of a next generation wireless communication network to accommodate the rapidly growing volume of data being transmitted to smart phones and other mobile devices requires new test and measurement equipment for research and development, conformance testing, production testing, installation and commissioning, monitoring and optimization, and service and maintenance.
research and development
We have a history of innovation and performance that has made us a leading supplier to our customers. We have proprietary technology that is based on the extensive know-how of our nearly 700 engineers and experienced management team, and a long history of research and development focused on specialized technologies, often in collaboration with customers. We leverage this proprietary technology to design and manufacture a range of RF, microwave and millimeter wave microelectronic components, with a focus on high reliability RadHard ICs. Our strength in the test and measurement market stems from our expertise in RF and microwave signals and innovative product development to meet the changing needs of wireless communications markets.

organizations. Additionally, the 7100/7000 products were developed for and are used by handset developers. Both the TM500 and 7100/7000 offerings target the research and development market. We have also introduced a PXI-based product that leverages our TM500 and 7100/7000 products, offering a configurable and scalable solution to handset manufacturers and contract manufacturing organizations that support the major handset makers. We continue to invest aggressively in new products for our various wireless test markets, increasingly using a common platform that allows us to bring them to market quickly and at relatively low cost.
research and development
We have successfully brought to market wireless instruments and system solutions that support a vertical market strategy specific to the chipset, product research and development and manufacturing test applications.
research and development
Wireless Test Equipment is used by wireless service providers and equipment manufacturers to test wireless handsets and base stations. We offer a wide selection of cellular tests across an array of wireless standards and communication frequencies, including 2G and 3G, with particular capability in EDGE protocols, and the new 4G WiMAX and LTE protocols. Products include a broad range of system, protocol, physical layer and parametric test solutions, such as the TM500 base station test mobile, RF synthesizers, digitizers and combiners, and application software. In addition, ATS provides PXI-based products which are modular scalable solutions for the handset manufacturing environment. Product applications include research and development, conformance, manufacturing/production, installation and commissioning, field service, and network optimization. ATS market leading product, the TM500, emulates a single or multi-handset environment and is used by all global infrastructure development organizations. Wireless Test Equipment products have a typical life cycle of 3-5 years.

We compete primarily on the basis of technology and performance. For certain products, we also compete on the basis of price. Some of our competitors are well-established and have greater market share and manufacturing, financial, research and development and marketing resources than we do. We also compete with emerging companies that are attempting to sell their products in specialized markets, and with the internal capabilities of many of our significant customers, including Honeywell and BAE Systems. In addition, a significant portion of our contracts, including those with the federal government and commercial customers, are subject to commercial bidding, both upon initial issuance and subsequent renewal.

We operate in a highly competitive industry. Current and prospective customers for our products evaluate our capabilities against the merits of our direct competitors. We compete primarily on the basis of technology and performance. For certain products, we also compete on price. Some of our competitors are well-established and have greater market share and manufacturing, financial, research and development and marketing resources than we do. We also compete with emerging companies that are attempting to sell their products in specialized markets, and with the internal capabilities of many of our significant customers, including Honeywell and BAE. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our current market share with respect to any of our products. A loss of market share to our competitors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, a significant portion of our contracts, including those with the federal government and commercial customers, are subject to commercial bidding, both upon initial issuance and subsequent renewal. If we are unable to successfully compete in the bidding process or if we fail to obtain renewal, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.

The level of research and development expense is related to the number of products in development, the state of the development process, the complexity of the underlying technology, the potential scale of the product upon successful commercialization, the level of our exploratory research and the extent to which product development and similar costs are recoverable under contractual arrangements. We generally conduct such activities in collaboration with our customers, which provides better visibility to areas we believe will accelerate our longer term sales growth. Our basic technologies have been developed through a combination of internal development, acquisitions of businesses with technologies in similar or adjacent fields and, more recently, through licenses. Our recent acquisitions have been more of a tuck-in nature, demonstrative of a business philosophy that is not hesitant to acquire a business when it is more cost efficient to buy technology than to develop it. Licenses have primarily been used to access technology geared to a commercial application that we can translate to a radiation hardened application for use in space.

In August 2007, we were ourselves acquired and taken private. The application of purchase accounting is, therefore, pervasive throughout our consolidated financial statements, most notably in the balance sheets amortizable and non-amortizable intangible asset accounts and in the statement of operations cost of sales, Going Private Transaction expense, amortization of intangibles and write-off of acquired in-process research and development costs.

At the acquisition date, the acquired IPR&D was not considered to have reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future uses. Therefore, the fair value of the IPR&D of $24.3 million was expensed at the time of the acquisition in operating costs. The allocation to IPR&D represents the estimated fair value of such incomplete research and development, at the acquisition date, based on future cash flows. As of the acquisition date, cash flows from these projects were expected to commence in fiscal year 2009. In determining the fair values of IPR&D, risk adjusted discount rates that ranged from 17% to 25% were applied to the projects cash flows, which have taken into account the respective projects completion percentage.

We are a leading provider of highly specialized microelectronics and test and measurement equipment, primarily to the global aerospace and defense and broadband communications markets. We also design application-specific integrated circuits, or ASICs, for CT scan equipment for the medical industry. Founded in 1937, we have developed a substantial intellectual property portfolio that includes more than 150 patents, extensive know-how, years of collaborative research and development with our customers and a demonstrated history in space, validating the high quality performance of our products. We believe that the combination of our leading market positions, complementary portfolio of products, years of experience and engineering capabilities provides us with a competitive advantage and enables us to deliver high performance, high value products to our customers.
research and development
As technology continues to evolve and “next generation” broadband communications, military and commercial avionics and two-way communications protocols are introduced, equipment manufacturers and network providers require test and measurement products that are compatible with the new technologies as well as products that work with older generation equipment. In addition, wireless companies need test equipment for all stages of development: research and development and conformance testing; production testing; installation and commissioning; monitoring and optimization; and service and maintenance. We have garnered specific expertise in advanced RF and additional wireless technology and have geared our research and development and product development toward such next-generation technologies. Over the years, we have been developing advanced solutions for our customers and providing a comprehensive collection of test and measurement equipment for all stages of the network life-cycle.
research and development
RF communications is a sub-segment of wireless communications and a significant area in which we compete. In addition to being a leader in RF test equipment, we also offer a range of RF products. The total available market for RF products is anticipated to expand as developing markets continue to emerge and as data-intensive networks enable new applications, such as music players, gaming and video services. Higher data rate handsets that offer higher functionality often contain multiple radios, thereby increasing the market for RF products. Multiple-input, multiple-output technology, which is used in several future standards to increase data rates, is also expected to increase the RF content of the phone. At the same time, lower-tier handsets that are optimized for emerging markets are driving new subscriber growth, which is also increasing the market for RF products. We believe that we are well-positioned to take advantage of this growth as we currently supply an extensive line of wireless test equipment to test RF components and we have garnered specific expertise in advanced RF and additional wireless technology and have focused our research and development and product development toward such next-generation technologies.
research and development
We have strong and long-standing relationships with top-tier defense, aerospace and broadband customers, including a significant number of defense-related technology companies. Our close customer relationships have enabled us to engage in collaborative product development over multi-year product life-cycles, build our intellectual property portfolio and develop critical product and end-market expertise, resulting in higher switching costs for our customers. We believe our long track record of design successes with our customers further benefits our ability to: (i) solidify our position as a sole source or primary supplier of products to customers across a wide array of programs; (ii) enjoy long multi-year platform relationships; (iii) maximize the effectiveness of our research and development spending; and (iv) minimize our customers’ product development time. Our customers include the five prime defense contractors (Boeing, General Dynamics, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman and Raytheon), as well as BAE, Cisco, Nokia, Motorola and Teradyne. Our products are used by customers in various aerospace and defense and broadband communications programs, providing us with increased revenue diversification and stability. In fiscal 2009, our largest customer represented approximately 9% of our net sales, demonstrating the diversity of our customer base. In addition to our diverse product base, we believe that we are well-positioned in domestic and international growth markets and believe that our geographic and product diversification helps to reduce the risk associated with the volatility of any one particular region or market segment.
research and development
We continue to allocate research and development spending toward new products serving large and/or growing markets. We endeavor to introduce new products to the market that allow us to move up to more profitable systems and products. We have transitioned from providing simple components, such as semiconductors, to more integrated products, including board-level and system-level products. Examples of recent new products include ASICs, satellite power subsystems and microwave/RF modules and receivers. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, we invested 11.7% of our net sales into self-funded research and development efforts. Examples of new product opportunities that we are pursuing are the CT scan market and the synthetic test market.

We plan to continue to improve our fixed cost position by critically examining the profitability of our operations and consolidating operations across facilities where operational synergies exist. In fiscal 2006, we implemented a plan to restructure our European businesses by consolidating a majority of our U.K. manufacturing operations into our Stevenage, England facility. In fiscal 2008, we continued to restructure our U.K. operations by further rationalizing duplicative research and development and selling, general and administrative activities, which resulted in the closure of our Burnham, England facility and relocation of its operations to Stevenage, England. In May 2008, we sold our radar system development and manufacturing business, or the Radar Division, which had been operating at a significant loss. We will continue to examine our operations for opportunities to further reduce costs, divest non-strategic businesses, increase cash flow and improve our margins.

We will continue to seek accretive acquisitions that provide complementary products and services, enhance our intellectual property and customer base, and provide entry into high-growth adjacent markets. We view our acquisition strategy as an extension of our research and development and marketing efforts. Recent strategic acquisitions in both the AMS and ATS segments have broadened and strengthened our product offering and technology portfolio. Since 2002, we have acquired 12 businesses and plan to opportunistically continue our disciplined approach to seeking accretive acquisitions. For instance:

research and development
We emphasize research and development efforts for products in both the AMS and ATS divisions. In AMS, we have geared our research and development capabilities toward continually introducing new, high value products, including the planned introduction of power subsystems and microwave/RF Modules and microreceivers between 2007 and 2009, enabling us to increase the number of our products embedded into modern satellites. In ATS, we are developing technologies that are used in the next generation of wireless infrastructure. Our research and development consists of self-funded research and development as well as research and development we conduct in collaboration with or on behalf of our customers.
research and development
Certain product development and similar costs are recoverable under contractual arrangements and those that are not recoverable are expensed in the year incurred. We invested $70.1 million in self funded research and development for fiscal 2009, $82.1 million for fiscal 2008 and $76.7 million for fiscal 2007.
research and development
We operate in a highly competitive industry. Current and prospective customers for our products evaluate our capabilities against the merits of our direct competitors. For all of our products, we compete primarily on the basis of both performance and price. Some of our competitors are well-established and have greater market share and manufacturing, financial, research and development and marketing resources than we do. We also compete with emerging companies that are attempting to sell their products in specialized markets, and with the internal capabilities of many of our significant customers, including Honeywell and BAE. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our current market share with respect to any of our products. A loss of market share to our competitors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, a significant portion of our contracts, including those with the federal government and commercial customers, are subject to commercial bidding, both upon initial issuance and recompetition. If we are unable to successfully compete in the bidding process or if we fail to obtain renewal, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.

At the acquisition date, the acquired in-process research and development (“IPR&D”) was not considered to have reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future uses. Therefore, the fair value of the IPR&D of $24.3 million was expensed at the time of the acquisition in operating costs. The allocation to IPR&D represents the estimated fair value of such incomplete research and development, at the acquisition date, based on future cash flows. As of the acquisition date, cash flows from these projects were expected to commence in fiscal year 2009. In determining the fair values of IPR&D, risk adjusted discount rates that ranged from 17% to 25% were applied to the projects’ cash flows, which have taken into account the respective projects’ completion percentage.

In connection with the acquisition of SPG, we allocated $2.8 million of the purchase price to incomplete research and development projects. In connection with the acquisition of JcAIR, we allocated $200,000 of the purchase price to incomplete research and development projects. These allocations represented the estimated fair value of such incomplete research and development projects, at the acquisition date, based on future cash flows that have been adjusted by the respective projects completion percentage. At the respective acquisition dates, the development of these projects had not yet reached technological feasibility and the research and development in progress had no alternative future uses. Accordingly, we expensed these costs as of the respective acquisition dates in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

The income tax provision was $14.4 million (an effective income tax rate of 43.5%) in fiscal 2005 and $12.5 million (an effective income tax rate of 37.8%) in fiscal 2004. The effective income tax rate for the two periods differed from the amount computed by applying the U.S. Federal income tax rate to income before income taxes primarily due to foreign, state and local income taxes, research and development credits and non-deductible in-process research and development costs. The primary difference in rates between the two years is due to the increase in domestic income relative to foreign income and a valuation allowance recorded on foreign losses. Domestic income is taxed at higher effective tax rates than foreign income which increases the overall global tax rate.

The developed technology and customer related intangibles are being amortized on a straight-line basis over a range of 3 to 15 years. The goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes. At the acquisition date, we expensed the value of the acquired in-process research and development because it was not considered to have reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future uses. The allocation to in-process research and development represents the estimated fair value of such incomplete research and development, at the acquisition date, based on future cash flows that have been adjusted by the respective projects completion percentage. As of the acquisition date, cash flows from these projects were expected to commence in fiscal 2006. A 24% risk adjusted discount rate was applied to the projects cash flows in determining fair value. At the acquisition date, JcAIR was conducting development activities associated with the completion of the Mode 5 General Avionic Test Equipment sets.

development cost
Certain product development and similar costs are recoverable under contractual arrangements and those that are not recoverable are expensed in the year incurred. The costs of our self-funded research activities were approximately $61.4 million for fiscal 2005, $50.0 million for fiscal 2004, and $29.5 million for fiscal 2003. The increase in fiscal 2005 from fiscal 2004 is primarily attributable to increased development costs associated with field programmable gate arrays ($3.8 million) and microelectronic modules ($1.4 million), the inclusion of MCE for a full year versus ten months last year ($1.2 million), and increased development expense for wireless communication test equipment ($3.3 million). The increase in fiscal 2004 from 2003 is primarily attributable to additional expense of MCE, RIWS and Celerity. In connection with our SPG and JcAIR acquisitions in fiscal 2005, we allocated $2.8 million and $200,000, respectively, of the purchase price to in-process research and development projects. In connection with our acquisitions of MCE, RIWS and Celerity in fiscal 2004, we allocated $420,000, $2.7 million and $1.1 million, respectively, of the purchase price to in-process research and development projects.

In connection with the acquisition of SPG, we allocated $2.8 million of the purchase price to incomplete research and development projects. In connection with the acquisition of JcAIR, we allocated $200,000 of the purchase price to incomplete research and development projects. These allocations represent the estimated fair value of such incomplete research and development projects, at the acquisition date, based on future cash flows that have been adjusted by the respective projects completion percentage. At the respective acquisition dates, the development of these projects had not yet reached technological feasibility and the research and development in progress had no alternative future uses. Accordingly, we expensed these costs as of the respective acquisition dates in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
research and development
At its acquisition date, SPG expected to spend approximately $2.2 million to complete all phases of the research and development, with anticipated completion dates ranging from two to five months from that date. At its acquisition date, JcAIR expected to spend approximately $900,000 to complete all phases of the research and development, with anticipated completion dates ranging from fifteen to twenty months from that date.
research and development
Revenue growth rates for the acquired companies were estimated based on a detailed forecast, as well as discussions with the finance, marketing and engineering personnel of the acquired companies. Allocation of total projected revenues to in-process research and development were based on discussions with the acquired companies management. Selling, general and administrative expenses and profitability estimates were determined based on forecasts as well as an analysis of comparable companies margin expectations.
development cost
We believe that the foregoing assumptions used in the forecasts were reasonable at the time of the acquisitions. No assurance can be given, however, that the underlying assumptions used to estimate sales, development costs or profitability, or the events associated with such projects will transpire as estimated. For these reasons, actual results may vary from projected results.
research and development
Remaining development efforts for the acquired companies research and development included various phases of design, development and testing. Funding for such projects is expected to come primarily from internally generated sources.
research and development
As evidenced by the continued support of the development of these projects, we believe we have a reasonable chance of successfully completing the research and development programs. However, as with all of our technology development, there is a risk associated with the completion of the research and development projects, and there is no assurance that technological or commercial success will be achieved.
research and development
If the development of these in-process research and development projects is unsuccessful, our sales and profitability may be adversely affected in future periods. Commercial results are also subject to certain market events and risks, which are beyond our control, such as trends in technology, changes in government regulation, market size and growth, and product introduction or other actions by competitors.

Self-funded research and development costs increased $3.0 million, or 25%, in the AMS segment primarily due to the addition of the expenses of MCE offset, in part, by reduced expenses in our microelectronic modules business. Research and development costs increased $17.4 million, or 102%, in the ATS segment primarily due to the addition of the expenses of RIWS, which historically had, and is expected to continue to have higher research and development costs.

Acquired In-Process Research and Development.
research and development
In connection with the acquisition of RIWS, we allocated $2.7 million of the purchase price to incomplete research and development projects. In connection with the acquisition of MCE, we allocated $420,000 of the purchase price to incomplete research and development projects. In connection with the acquisition of Celerity, we allocated $1.1 million of the purchase price to incomplete research and development projects. These allocations represent the estimated fair value of such incomplete research and development, at the acquisition date, based on future cash flows that have been adjusted by the respective projects' completion percentage. At the respective acquisition dates, the development of these projects had not yet reached technological feasibility and the research and development in progress had no alternative future uses. Accordingly, we expensed these costs as of the respective acquisition dates in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
research and development
At its acquisition date, RIWS expected to spend approximately $8.9 million to complete all phases of the research and development, with completion anticipated in 2004. At its acquisition date, MCE expected to spend approximately $100,000 to complete all phases of the research and development, with anticipated completion dates ranging from 6 to 12 months from that date. At its acquisition date, Celerity expected to spend approximately $700,000 to complete all phases of the research and development, with anticipated completion dates ranging from 6 to 18 months from that date.
research and development
Revenue growth rates for the acquired company were estimated based on a detailed forecast, as well as discussions with the finance, marketing and engineering personnel of the acquired companies. Allocation of total projected revenues to in-process research and development were based on discussions with the acquired companies' management. Selling, general and administrative expenses and profitability estimates were determined based on forecasts as well as an analysis of comparable companies' margin expectations.
development cost
We believe that the foregoing assumptions used in the forecasts were reasonable at the time of the acquisitions. No assurance can be given, however, that the underlying assumptions used to estimate sales, development costs or profitability, or the events associated with such projects will transpire as estimated. For these reasons, actual results may vary from projected results.
research and development
Remaining development efforts for the acquired companies' research and development included various phases of design, development and testing. Funding for such projects is expected to come primarily from internally generated sources.
research and development
As evidenced by the continued support of the development of these projects, we believe we have a reasonable chance of successfully completing the research and development programs. However, as with all of our technology development, there is risk associated with the completion of the research and development projects, and there is no assurance that technological or commercial success will be achieved.
research and development
If the development of these in-process research and development projects is unsuccessful, our sales and profitability may be adversely affected in future periods. Commercial results are also subject to certain market events and risks, which are beyond our control, such as trends in technology, changes in government regulation, market size and growth, and product introduction or other actions by competitors.

Research and Development Costs. Research and development costs include material, engineering labor and allocated overhead. Our self-funded research and development costs increased 25.3% to $23.7 million (11.7% of net sales) in fiscal 2002 from $18.9 million (8.1% of net sales) in fiscal 2001. The increase was primarily due to UTMC's efforts toward the development of new integrated circuits and the additional expenses of IFR.

Acquired In-Process Research and Development. In connection with the acquisition of IFR, we allocated $1.1 million of the purchase price to incomplete research and development projects. This allocation represents the estimated fair value based on future cash flows that have been adjusted by the projects' completion percentage. At the acquisition date, the development of these projects had not yet reached technological feasibility and the research and development in progress had no alternative future uses. Accordingly, we expensed these costs as of the acquisition date.
research and development
At its acquisition date, IFR expected to spend approximately $3.5 million to complete all phases of the research and development, with anticipated completion dates ranging from 5 to 10 months from that date.
research and development
Revenue growth rates for the acquired company were estimated based on a detailed forecast, as well as discussions with the finance, marketing and engineering personnel of IFR. Allocation of total projected revenues to in-process research and development was based on discussions with IFR's management. Selling, general and administrative expenses and profitability estimates were determined based on forecasts as well as an analysis of comparable companies' margin expectations.
development cost
We believe that the foregoing assumptions used in the forecasts were reasonable at the time of the acquisition. No assurance can be given, however, that the underlying assumptions used to estimate sales, development costs or profitability, or the events associated with such projects will transpire as estimated. For these reasons, actual results may vary from projected results.
research and development
Remaining development efforts for IFR's research and development included various phases of design, development and testing. Funding for such projects is expected to come primarily from internally generated sources.
research and development
As evidenced by the continued support of the development of IFR's projects, we believe we have a reasonable chance of successfully completing the research and development programs. However, as with all of our technology development, there is risk associated with the completion of the research and development projects, and there is no assurance that technological or commercial success will be achieved.
research and development
If the development of these in-process research and development projects is unsuccessful, our sales and profitability may be adversely affected in future periods. Commercial results are also subject to certain market events and risks, which are beyond our control, such as trends in technology, changes in government regulation, market size and growth, and product introduction or other actions by competitors.

Provision (Benefit) for Income Taxes. The income tax benefit was $3.0 million (an effective income tax rate of 21.5%) in fiscal 2002 and the income tax provision was $11.5 million (an effective income tax rate of 35.0%) in fiscal 2001. The income tax provisions for the two periods differed from the amount computed by applying the U.S. Federal income tax rate to income before income taxes primarily due to non-deductible charges for acquired in-process R&D and impairment and amortization of goodwill, state and local income taxes and research and development credits.

Certain product development and similar costs are recoverable under contractual arrangements and those that are not recoverable are expensed in the year incurred. The costs of our self-funded research activities were approximately $18.9 million for fiscal 2001, $11.6 million for fiscal 2000 and $10.1 million for fiscal 1999. The increases are primarily attributable to the addition of the expenses of our newly acquired companies and increased costs for the further development of frequency synthesizers and high speed automatic test systems. Also, in connection with our acquisitions of RDL, Inc. and TriLink Communications Corp. in fiscal 2001, we allocated $1.5 million (for RDL) and $1.0 million (for TriLink) of the purchase prices to incomplete research and development projects. In connection with our acquisition of UTMC Microelectronic Systems in February 1999, we allocated $3.5 million of the purchase price to incomplete research and development projects. Since the research and development projects had not reached technological feasibility at the time of the acquisition, these amounts were charged to expense in the respective years in addition to the self-funded research and development costs, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

In May 2000, we sold 6.3 million shares (adjusted for a five-for-four stock split and a two-for-one stock split) of our common stock in a public offering for $68.5 million, net of an underwriting discount of $3.5 million and issuance costs of $500,000. Of these net proceeds, $13.0 million was used to repay the term loan. The balance of the net proceeds is invested in short-term marketable securities and is intended to be used ultimately for additional working capital, including research and development, for expansion of our facilities, and for general corporate purposes, including possible acquisitions of technologies, product lines or businesses.

Certain product development and similar costs are recoverable under contractual arrangements and those that are not recoverable are expensed in the year incurred. The costs of our self-funded research activities were approximately $11.0 million for fiscal 2000, $9.6 million for fiscal 1999 and $5.2 million for fiscal 1998. The increases are primarily attributable to our development of a low-cost, high-speed, high-performance frequency synthesizer intended for commercial communication test systems as well as, for fiscal 2000 and 1999, the addition of the expenses of Aeroflex UTMC Microelectronic Systems. Also, in connection with our acquisition of UTMC Microelectronic Systems in February 1999, we allocated $3.5 million of the purchase price to incomplete research and development projects. Since the research and development projects had not reached technological feasibility, $3.5 million was charged to expense in fiscal 1999 in addition to the $9.6 million, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

We believe that to remain competitive in the future, we will need to invest significant financial resources in research and development.

Research and Development Costs. Research and development costs include material, engineering labor and allocated overhead. Our self-funded research and development costs increased 14.2% to $11.0 million (5.9% of net sales) in fiscal 2000 from $9.6 million (6.1% of net sales) in fiscal 1999. This increase was primarily attributable to the additional costs of UTMC Microelectronic Systems, partially offset by reduced costs, relative to the prior year, related to the development of the FS- 1000, a low-cost, high speed, high performance frequency synthesizer intended for commercial communication test systems, which was completed in early fiscal 2000.

Acquired In-Process Research and Development. In connection with the acquisition of UTMC Microelectronic Systems, we allocated $3.5 million of the purchase price to incomplete research and development projects. This allocation represents the estimated fair value based on future cash flows that have been adjusted by the projects' completion percentage. At the acquisition date, the development of these projects had not yet reached technological feasibility and the research and development in progress had no alternative future uses. Accordingly, we expensed these costs as of the acquisition date.
research and development
We used an independent third-party appraiser to assess and value the in-process research and development. The value assigned to this asset was determined by identifying significant research projects for which technological feasibility had not been established. In the case of UTMC Microelectronic Systems, this included the design, development, and testing activities associated with its commercial products, data bus products, radiation hardened
research and development
products and application specific integrated circuits. The research and development projects are associated with the introduction of several new products as well as specific significant enhancements to existing products. Valuation of development efforts in the future has been excluded from the research and development appraisal.
research and development
Revenue growth rates for UTMC Microelectronic Systems were estimated by the third party appraiser based on a detailed forecast we prepared, as well as the appraiser's discussions with our finance, marketing and engineering personnel and those of UTMC Microelectronic Systems. Allocation of total UTMC Microelectronic Systems' projected revenues to in-process research and development was based on the appraiser's discussions with UTMC Microelectronic Systems' management and us. A significant portion of UTMC Microelectronic Systems' future revenues was expected to originate from the sale of products that were not yet completed at acquisition. However, UTMC Microelectronic Systems' existing products and technologies are expected to generate sales through 2008.
development cost
We believe that the foregoing assumptions used in the forecasts were reasonable at the time of the acquisition. No assurance can be given, however, that the underlying assumptions used to estimate sales, development costs or profitability, or the events associated with such projects will transpire as estimated. For these reasons, actual results may vary from projected results.
research and development
Remaining development efforts for UTMC Microelectronic Systems' research and development include various phases of design, development and testing. Funding for such projects is expected to come from internally generated sources.
research and development
As evidenced by the continued support of the development of its projects, we believe we have a reasonable chance of successfully completing the research and development programs. However, as with all of our technology development, there is risk associated with the completion of the UTMC Microelectronic Systems' research and development projects, and there is no assurance that technological or commercial success will be achieved.
research and development
If the development of UTMC Microelectronic Systems' in-process research and development project is unsuccessful, our sales and profitability may be adversely affected in future periods. Commercial results are also subject to certain market events and risks, which are beyond our control, such as trends in technology, changes in government regulation, market size and growth, and product introduction or other actions by competitors.

Provision for Income Taxes. Income taxes increased 50.5% to $7.2 million (an effective income tax rate of 35.0%, exclusive of the special charge) in fiscal 1999, from $4.8 million (an effective income tax rate of 36.1%) in fiscal 1998. The income tax provisions for the years ended June 30, 1999 and 1998 were different from the amounts computed by applying the U.S. Federal income tax rate to income before income taxes primarily due to state and local income taxes and research and development credits, and for the year ended June 30, 1999, due to the non-deductibility of the $3.5 million special charge.

research and development
We have research and development locations in Czechia, France, Germany, India, Israel, Japan, Malaysia, South Korea, the United Kingdom and the United States, although a certain level of innovation occurs at every one of our manufacturing sites. We developed numerous new products and product extensions during fiscal 2019 in addition to those added through our acquisition activity. These new products add to the broad product line we offer to our customers. Our research scientists and design engineers are working to develop product solutions to the challenges facing our customers as consumers and businesses demand more advanced electronic solutions to manage their everyday lives and businesses. Our engineers are continually working to enhance our manufacturing processes to improve capability, capacity, and yield, while reducing manufacturing costs.
research and development
We also manufacture and resell a broad line of advanced electronic components to fill the special needs of our customers. Our family of advanced components includes specialized ceramic, tantalum and film capacitors, polymer and EDLC capacitors, high energy/voltage power capacitors, passive and active antennas and varistors. Our advanced product engineers work with some customers’ in-house technical staffs to design and manufacture customized products to meet the specifications of particular applications. The manufacture of custom products permits us, through our research and development activities, to make technological advances, provide customers with design solutions to fit their needs, gain a marketing inroad with customers with respect to our complete product line, and, in some cases, develop products that can be sold to additional customers in the future. Sales of advanced electronic components accounted for approximately 38% of Electronic Component segment net sales in fiscal 2019.
research and development
We place a high priority on solving customers’ electronic component design challenges and responding to their needs. In order to better serve our customers, we frequently designate teams consisting of marketing, field application engineering, research and development, and manufacturing personnel to work with customers to design and manufacture products to suit their specific requirements. We expense costs related to these activities as incurred.
research and development
Our emphasis on research and development is evidenced by the fact that most of our manufactured products and manufacturing processes have been designed and developed by our own engineers and scientists. Our research and development activities are carried out at facilities located in Czechia, France, Germany, India, Israel, Japan, Malaysia, South Korea, the United Kingdom and the United States, although a certain level of innovation occurs at all of our manufacturing sites.
research and development
Our research and development effort and our operational-level engineering effort place a priority on the design and development of product extensions, innovative new products, and improved manufacturing processes as well as engineering advances in existing product lines and manufacturing operations. Other areas of emphasis include material synthesis and the integration of components for applications requiring reduced size and lower manufacturing costs associated with circuit board assembly. Research, development, and engineering expenditures were approximately $31 million, $42 million, and $60 million during fiscal 2017, 2018, and 2019, respectively. The 2018 and 2019 expenditures include the impact of the three businesses acquired during those years. The level of such spending can fluctuate as new products are transferred to full-scale production and process enhancements are implemented.
research and development
In addition to our own research and development initiatives, we may invest in technology start-up enterprises, in which we may acquire a controlling or non-controlling interest but whose technology would be available to be commercialized by us. There are numerous risks in investments of this nature, including the limited operating history of such start-up entities, their need for capital, their limited or absence of production experience, as well as the risk that their technologies may prove ineffective or fail to gain acceptance in the marketplace. There can be no assurance that our current and future investments in start-up enterprises will prove successful.

We are organized by product line with five main product groups. Our reportable segments are based on the types of products from which we generate revenues. We have three reportable segments: Passive Components, Kyocera Electronic Devices ("KED Resale") and Interconnect. The product groups of Ceramic Components, Advanced Components and Tantalum Components have been aggregated into the Passive Component reportable segment. Segment revenue and profit information is presented in Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements. The Passive Components segment consists primarily of surface mount and leaded ceramic capacitors, RF thick and thin film components, tantalum capacitors, film capacitors, ceramic and film power capacitors, super capacitors, EMI filters, thick and thin film packages, varistors, thermistors, inductors and resistive products. The KED Resale segment consists primarily of ceramic capacitors, frequency control devices, SAW devices, sensor products, RF modules, actuators, acoustic devices and connectors produced by Kyocera, and resold by AVX. The Interconnect segment consists primarily of AVX Interconnect (formerly Elco) automotive, telecom and memory connectors manufactured by AVX. In addition, we have a corporate administration group consisting of finance and administrative activities and a separate research and development group.
research and development
We have research and development locations in the United States, United Kingdom, Czech Republic, France and Israel. We developed numerous new products and product extensions during fiscal 2012 and won several awards that recognize our technology leadership. These new products add to the broad product line we offer to our customers. Due to our broad product offering, none of our products individually represent a material portion of our revenues. Our scientists are working to develop product solutions to the challenges facing our customers as consumers and business demand more advanced electronic solutions to manage their everyday lives and businesses. Our engineers are continually working to enhance our manufacturing processes to improve capability, capacity and yield, while continuing to reduce manufacturing costs.

On April 2, 2004, we completed our acquisition of certain sales and marketing subsidiaries from Kinseki Ltd. of Japan ("KSS"), a wholly owned subsidiary of Kyocera. Effective April 1, 2004, we have reorganized into a product line organization with five main product groups: Ceramic, Tantalum, Advanced, Connector and Kyocera Electronic Devices ("KED"). The KED division will contain the new KSS product group, along with Kyocera Developed Products ("KDP") group that is currently reported in the passive group segment and Kyocera Elco Connectors ("KEC") group that is currently reported in the connectors segment. Managers of each business unit will be responsible for the sales, marketing, production, research and development, and profitability of their division. We are evaluating the impact this reorganization will have on our segment reporting, and accordingly all segment reporting for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2005 will reflect the changes required under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards 131, "Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information" ("SFAS 131").

Creating Technology Leadership. We have five principal research and development locations in the United States, Northern Ireland, England, France and Israel. During fiscal 2004, twelve patents were granted, twenty patent applications were submitted and numerous new products were developed. These new products add to the broad product line we offer to our customers. Due to our broad product offering, none of our products individually represent a material portion of our revenues. Our scientists are working to develop product solutions to the challenges facing our customers. Our engineers are continually improving our manufacturing processes to improve capability, capacity and yield, while continuing to reduce manufacturing costs.

We offer an extensive line of passive components designed to provide our customers with "one-stop shopping" for substantially all of their passive component needs. Passive components represented approximately 90% of our net sales in fiscal 2004, and connectors accounted for approximately 10% of our net sales in fiscal 2004. In addition, the table below presents revenues from external customers for fiscal 2002, 2003 and 2004 by product group. Financial information concerning our passive components, connectors and research and development segments is set forth in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this Form 10-K.
research and development
We also offer a line of advanced passive component products to fill the special needs of our customers. Our advanced products engineers work with some customers' in-house technical staffs to design, produce and manufacture special products to meet the specifications of particular applications. The manufacture of special products permits us, through our research and development activities, to make technological advances, provide customers with design solutions to fit their needs, gain a marketing inroad with the customer with respect to our complete product line and, in some cases, develop products that can be sold to additional customers in the future. Our advanced products division presently has significant ongoing projects with a variety of key customers. Sales of advanced products accounted for approximately 25% of passive component net sales in fiscal 2004.
research and development
We place a high priority on solving customers' electronic component design challenges and responding to their needs. We frequently form teams consisting of marketing, research and development and manufacturing personnel to work with customers to design and manufacture products to suit their specific requirements.
research and development
Our emphasis on research and development is evidenced by the fact that most of our manufactured products and manufacturing processes have been designed and developed by our own engineers and scientists. A 60,000 square-foot facility in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina is dedicated entirely to pure research and development and provides centralized coordination of our global research and development efforts. We also maintain significant research and development staffs at our facilities in Northern Ireland, England, Israel and France.

development cost
Research, development and engineering expenditures, which encompass the personnel and related expenses devoted to developing new and maintaining existing products, processes and technical innovations, were approximately $38.6 million and $43.5 million in fiscal 2004 and 2003, respectively. Research and development costs for the development of new products and processes are primarily classified in selling, general and administrative expenses, while engineering costs in connection with existing products and processes are primarily included in cost of sales. The decline in research and development expenses was partially due to the transfer from development to production of certain new products. The costs were incurred as we continue to enhance existing product lines, develop new products, convert to the use of base metals in the manufacture of ceramic capacitors and develop high capacitance capacitors.

In January 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Interpretation No. 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities" ("FIN 46"). Variable interest entities often are created for a single specified purpose, for example, to facilitate securitization, leasing, hedging, research and development, or other transactions or arrangements. Formerly "Consolidation of Certain Special Purpose Entities" in its draft form, this interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51, "Consolidated Financial Statements", defines what these variable interest entities are and provides guidelines on how to identify them and also on how an enterprise should assess its interests in a variable interest entity to decide whether to consolidate that entity. Generally, FIN 46 applies to variable interest entities created after January 31, 2003, and to variable interest entities in which an enterprise obtains an interest after that date. For existing variable interest entities in which an enterprise holds a variable interest that it acquired before February 1, 2003, the provisions of this interpretation will apply no later than the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period beginning after June 15, 2003. In December 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued a revised FIN 46 ("FIN 46-R") to address certain FIN 46 implementation issues. The effective dates and impact of FIN 46 and FIN 46-R are as follows: (i) for special-purpose entities ("SPEs") created prior to February 1, 2003, we must apply either the provisions of FIN 46 or early adopt the provisions of FIN 46-R at the end of the first interim or annual reporting period ending after December 15, 2003; (ii) for non-SPEs created prior to February 1, 2003, we are required to adopt FIN 46-R at the end of the first interim or annual reporting period ending after March 15, 2004; and (iii) for all entities, regardless of whether an SPE, that were created subsequent to January 31, 2003, the provisions of FIN 46 were applicable for variable interests in entities obtained after January 31, 2003. We did not have any variable interest entities during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2004. Accordingly, the adoption of FIN 46 and FIN 46-R did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.

We offer an extensive line of passive components designed to provide our customers with "one-stop shopping" for substantially all of their passive component needs. Passive components represented approximately 93% of our net sales and connectors accounted for approximately 7% of our net sales in fiscal 2001. Financial information concerning our passive components, connectors and research and development segments is set forth in our consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-K.
research and development
We also offer a line of advanced passive component products to fill the special needs of our customers. Our advanced products engineers work with some customers' in-house technical staffs to design, produce and manufacture special products to meet the specifications of particular applications. The manufacture of special products permits us, through our research and development activities, to make technological advances, provide customers with design solutions to fit their needs, gain a marketing inroad with the customer with respect to our complete product line and, in some cases, develop products that can be sold to additional customers in the future. Our advanced products division presently has significant ongoing projects with a variety of key customers. Sales of advanced products accounted for approximately 19% of passive component net sales in fiscal 2001.
research and development
We place a high priority on solving customers' electronic component problems and responding to their needs. We frequently form teams consisting of marketing, research and development and manufacturing personnel to work with customers to design and manufacture products to suit their specific requirements.
research and development
Our emphasis on research and development is reflected by the fact that most of our manufactured products and manufacturing processes have been designed and developed by our own engineers and scientists. Our 60,000 square-foot facility in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina is dedicated entirely to pure research and development, and provides centralized coordination of our global research and development efforts. We also maintain significant research and development staffs at our facilities in Northern Ireland, England, Israel and France.
research and development
Virtually all manufacturing, research and development and warehousing facilities could at any time be involved in the manufacturing, sale or distribution of passive components (PC) and connector products (CP). The following is a list of our facilities, their square footage, whether they are leased or owned and a description of their use.

Selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended March 31, 2001 were $149.3 million (5.7% of net sales), compared with $119.3 million (7.3% of net sales) for the year ended March 31, 2000. The decline in selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of sales, is a result of higher sales. The increase in selling general and administrative expenses is mainly attributable to higher sales commissions ($14.5 million increase). Other contributing factors include increases in research and development costs, charitable contributions, goodwill amortization and various selling and administrative costs.

In December 2014, the ACC voted that it had no objection to APS implementing an APS-owned rooftop solar research and development program aimed at learning how to efficiently enable the integration of rooftop solar and battery storage with the grid. The first stage of the program, called the "Solar Partner Program," placed 8 MW of residential rooftop solar on strategically selected distribution feeders in an effort to maximize potential system benefits, as well as made systems available to limited-income customers who could not easily install solar through transactions with third parties. The second stage of the program, which included an additional 2 MW of rooftop solar and energy storage, placed two energy storage systems sized at 2 MW on two different high solar penetration feeders to test various grid-related operation improvements and system interoperability, and was in operation by the end of 2016. The costs for this program have been included in APS's rate base as part of the 2017 Rate Case Decision.

In 2009, the DOE announced an ARRA commitment to fund the majority of a carbon dioxide emission reduction research and development project in the amount of $71 million, which was to be located at our Cholla power plant. Due to the increased resource and funding requirements for a project of that size, APS elected not to move forward with that award and is now in the process of closing out the project. However, APS is moving forward with work under the $3 million award from DOE for a high penetration photovoltaic generation study related to the Community Power Project in Flagstaff, Arizona. The funding under this DOE award will continue to be contingent upon meeting certain project milestones, including DOE-established budget parameters, over the next four years.

We determined fair value for our real estate assets primarily based on the future cash flows that we estimated would be generated by each asset discounted for market risk. Our impairment assessments and fair value determinations required significant judgment regarding key assumptions such as future sales prices, future construction and land development costs, future sales timing, and discount rates. The assumptions were specific to each project and may have varied among projects. The discount rates we used to determine fair values at December 31, 2009 ranged from 11% to 29%. Due to the judgment and assumptions applied in the estimation process, with regard to impairments, it is possible that actual results could have differed from those estimates.

During 2008, particularly late in the year, the real estate market weakened significantly resulting from the severe liquidity shortages in the financial markets, oversupply of home inventories, tight credit markets and downward pressure on residential and commercial property values. The effects of these factors have resulted in elevated cancellation rates, low sales absorption rates and overall weak consumer confidence. In recent months, the overall economy has weakened significantly and fears of a prolonged recession are now pronounced due to rising unemployment levels, further deterioration in consumer confidence and reduced consumer spending. Also, because of terms of renewal of SunCors Secured Revolver (see Note 6), during the fourth quarter of 2008, we revised forecasts related to potential disposal of certain assets classified as home inventory and as held and used. These factors resulted in 2008 impairment charges of $24 million related to our home inventory, which is considered held for sale and $29 million related to our held and used assets. The held and used assets include a project under development, an office building, a golf course, and completed home lots in Arizona.

research and development
Abbott's research and development efforts may not succeed in developing commercially successful products and technologies, which may cause Abbott's revenue and profitability to decline.
research and development
To remain competitive, Abbott must continue to launch new products and technologies. To accomplish this, Abbott commits substantial efforts, funds, and other resources to research and development. A risk of failure is inherent in the research and development of new products and technologies. Abbott must make ongoing substantial expenditures without any assurance that its efforts will be commercially successful. Failure can occur at any point in the process, including after significant funds have been invested.
research and development
Abbott's research and development facilities in the United States are primarily located in California, Illinois, Minnesota, New Jersey, and Ohio. Abbott also has research and development facilities in various other countries, including China, Colombia, India, Singapore, Spain, and the United Kingdom.
research and development
 Abbott has acquired and continues to acquire significant intangible assets that Abbott records at fair value at the acquisition date. Transactions involving the purchase or sale of intangible assets occur with some frequency between companies in the health care field and valuations are usually based on a discounted cash flow analysis. The discounted cash flow model requires assumptions about the timing and amount of future net cash flows, risk, cost of capital, terminal values and market participants. Each of these factors can significantly affect the value of the intangible asset. Abbott engages independent valuation experts who review Abbott's critical assumptions and calculations for acquisitions of significant intangibles. Abbott reviews definite-lived intangible assets for impairment each quarter using an undiscounted net cash flows approach. If the undiscounted cash flows of an intangible asset are less than the carrying value of an intangible asset, the intangible asset is written down to its fair value, which is usually the discounted cash flow amount. Where cash flows cannot be identified for an individual asset, the review is applied at the lowest group level for which cash flows are identifiable. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, which relate to in-process research and development acquired in a business combination, are reviewed for impairment annually or when an event that could result in impairment occurs. At December 31, 2018, goodwill amounted to $23.3 billion and net intangibles amounted to $18.9 billion. Amortization expense in continuing operations for intangible assets amounted to $2.2 billion in 2018, $2.0 billion in 2017 and $550 million in 2016. There was no significant reduction of goodwill relating to impairments in 2018, 2017 and 2016.
research and development
Research and development expense was $2.3 billion in 2018, $2.3 billion in 2017, and $1.4 billion in 2016 and represented a 1.7 percent increase in 2018, and a 56.2 percent increase in 2017. The 2018 increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to higher spending on various projects, partially offset by lower restructuring and integration costs. The 2017 increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to the acquisition of the St. Jude Medical business. In 2018, research and development expenditures totaled $1.0 billion for the Cardiovascular and Neuromodulation Products
research and development
In 2017 and 2018, Abbott management approved restructuring plans as part of the integration of the acquisition of St. Jude Medical into the Cardiovascular and Neuromodulation Products segment and Alere into the Diagnostic Products segment, in order to leverage economies of scale and reduce costs. Abbott recorded charges, including one-time employee termination benefits, of approximately $52 million in 2018 and $187 million in 2017. Approximately $5 million in 2018 and 2017 are recorded in Cost of products sold, approximately $10 million in 2018 is recorded in Research and development and approximately $37 million in 2018 and $182 million in 2017 in Selling, general and administrative expense.
research and development
From 2016 to 2018, Abbott management approved plans to streamline operations in order to reduce costs and improve efficiencies in various Abbott businesses including the nutritional, established pharmaceuticals and vascular businesses. Abbott recorded employee-related severance and other charges of approximately $28 million in 2018, $120 million in 2017 and $32 million in 2016. Approximately $10 million in 2018, $7 million in 2017 and $9 million in 2016 are recorded in Cost of products sold, approximately $2 million in 2018, $77 million in 2017 and $5 million in 2016 are recorded in Research and development and approximately $16 million in 2018, $36 million in 2017 and $18 million in 2016 are recorded in Selling, general and administrative expense. Additional charges of approximately $2 million in 2017 and 2016 were recorded primarily for accelerated depreciation.

Research and Development Programs

Research and Development Process
research and development
In the Diagnostics segment, the phases of the research and development process include:
research and development
In the Cardiovascular and Neuromodulation segment, the research and development process begins with research on a specific technology that is evaluated for feasibility and commercial viability. If the research program passes that hurdle, it moves forward into development. The development process includes evaluation, selection and qualification of a product design, completion of applicable clinical trials to test the product's safety and efficacy, and validation of the manufacturing process to demonstrate its repeatability and ability to consistently meet pre-determined specifications.
research and development
In the Nutritional segment, the research and development process generally focuses on identifying and developing ingredients and products that address the nutritional needs of particular populations (e.g., infants and adults) or patients (e.g., people with diabetes). Depending upon the country and/or region, if claims regarding a product's efficacy will be made, clinical studies typically must be conducted.
research and development
Cardiovascular and Neuromodulation  Abbott's research and development programs focus on:
research and development
Rapid Diagnostics  Abbott's research and development programs focus on the development of diagnostic products for cardiometabolic disease, infectious disease and toxicology.
research and development
Nutritionals  Abbott is focusing its research and development spend on platforms that span the pediatric and adult nutrition areas: gastro intestinal/immunity health, brain health, mobility and metabolism, and user experience platforms. Numerous new products that build on advances in these platforms are currently under development, including clinical outcome testing, and are expected to be launched over the coming years.
research and development
Given the diversity of Abbott's business, its intention to remain a broad-based healthcare company and the numerous sources for potential future growth, no individual project is expected to be material to cash flows or results of operations over the next five years. Factors considered included research and development expenses projected to be incurred for the project over the next year relative to Abbott's total research and development expenses, as well as qualitative factors, such as marketplace perceptions and impact of a new product on Abbott's overall market position. There were no delays in Abbott's 2018 research and development activities that are expected to have a material impact on operations.
research and development
While the aggregate cost to complete the numerous projects currently in development is expected to be material, the total cost to complete will depend upon Abbott's ability to successfully finish each project, the rate at which each project advances, and the ultimate timing for completion. Given the potential for significant delays and the risk of failure inherent in the development of medical device, diagnostic and pharmaceutical products and technologies, it is not possible to accurately estimate the total cost to complete all projects currently in development. Abbott plans to manage its portfolio of projects to achieve research and development spending that will be competitive in each of the businesses in which it participates, and such spending is expected to approximate 7.5 percent of total Abbott sales in 2019. Abbott does not regularly accumulate or make management decisions based on the total expenses incurred for a particular development phase in a given period.
research and development
Capital expenditures of $1.4 billion in 2018, $1.1 billion in 2017 and $1.1 billion in 2016 were principally for upgrading and expanding manufacturing and research and development facilities and equipment in various segments, investments in information technology, and laboratory instruments placed with customers.

Indefinite-lived intangible assets, which relate to in-process research and development acquired in a business combination, were approximately $3.6 billion and $3.9 billion at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The decrease in indefinite-lived intangible assets in 2018 primarily relates to purchase price allocation adjustments associated with the Alere acquisition. In 2017, in-process research and development increased by $4.5 billion due to the completion of the St. Jude Medical and Alere acquisitions, a portion of which became amortizable during the year. In 2017, Abbott also recorded a $53 million impairment of an

Amortization expense in continuing operations for intangible assets amounted to $2.0 billion in 2017, $550 million in 2016 and $601 million in 2015. There was no significant reduction of goodwill relating to impairments in 2017, 2016 and 2015.

Research and development expense was $2.235 billion in 2017, $1.422 billion in 2016, and $1.405 billion in 2015 and represented a 57.2 percent increase in 2017, and a 1.2 percent increase in 2016. The 2017 increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to the acquisition of the St. Jude Medical business. The 2016 increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to higher spending on various projects and the impairment of an in-process research and development asset related to a non-reportable segment, partially offset by lower restructuring costs in 2016. In 2017, research and development expenditures totaled $526 million for the Diagnostics Products segment, $967 million for the Cardiovascular and Neuromodulation Products segment, $195 million for the Nutritional Products segment, and $164 million for the Established Pharmaceutical Products segment.

acquisition resulted in non-deductible acquired in-process research and development of approximately $220 million, which is accounted for as an indefinite-lived intangible asset until regulatory approval or discontinuation, non-deductible goodwill of approximately $142 million, deferred tax assets and other net assets of approximately $18 million, deferred tax liabilities of approximately $85 million, and contingent consideration of approximately $70 million. The goodwill is identifiable to the Cardiovascular and Neuromodulation Products segment. If the acquisition of Tendyne had taken place as of the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period, consolidated net sales and earnings would not have been significantly different from reported amounts.

From 2014 to 2017, Abbott management approved plans to streamline operations in order to reduce costs and improve efficiencies in various Abbott businesses including the nutritional, established pharmaceuticals and vascular businesses. Abbott recorded employee-related severance and other charges of approximately $120 million in 2017, $33 million in 2016 and $95 million in 2015. Approximately $7 million in 2017, $9 million in 2016 and $18 million in 2015 are recorded in Cost of products sold, approximately $77 million in 2017, $5 million in 2016 and $34 million in 2015 are recorded in Research and development and approximately $36 million in 2017, $19 million in 2016 and $43 million in 2015 are recorded in Selling, general and administrative expense. Additional charges of approximately $2 million in 2017, $2 million in 2016 and $45 million in 2015 were recorded primarily for accelerated depreciation.

In 2016, taxes on earnings from continuing operations include the impact of a net tax benefit of approximately $225 million, primarily as a result of the resolution of various tax positions from prior years, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of non-deductible foreign exchange losses related to Venezuela and the adjustment of the Mylan N.V. equity investment, as well as the recognition of deferred taxes associated with the then pending sale of AMO. In 2015, taxes on earnings from continuing operations include $71 million of tax expense related to gain on the disposal of shares of Mylan N.V. stock. The 2015 effective tax rate includes the impact of the R&D tax credit that was made permanent in the U.S. by the Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015.

Research and Development Process
research and development
In the Diagnostics segment, the phases of the research and development process include:
research and development
In the Cardiovascular and Neuromodulation segment, the research and development process begins with research on a specific technology that is evaluated for feasibility and commercial viability. If the research program passes that hurdle, it moves forward into development. The development process includes evaluation, selection and qualification of a product design, completion of applicable clinical trials to test the product's safety and efficacy, and validation of the manufacturing process to demonstrate its repeatability and ability to consistently meet pre-determined specifications.
research and development
In the Nutritional segment, the research and development process generally focuses on identifying and developing ingredients and products that address the nutritional needs of particular populations (e.g., infants and adults) or patients (e.g., people with diabetes). Depending upon the country and/or region, if claims regarding a product's efficacy will be made, clinical studies typically must be conducted.
research and development
Cardiovascular and Neuromodulation  Abbott's research and development programs focus on:
research and development
Rapid Diagnostics  Abbott's research and development programs focus on the development of diagnostic products for cardiometabolic disease, infectious disease and toxicology.
research and development
Nutritionals  Abbott is focusing its research and development spend on platforms that span the pediatric, adult and performance nutrition areas: gastro intestinal/immunity health, brain health, mobility and metabolism, and user experience platforms. Numerous new products that build on advances in these platforms are currently under development, including clinical outcome testing, and are expected to be launched over the coming years.
research and development
Given the diversity of Abbott's business, its intention to remain a broad-based healthcare company and the numerous sources for potential future growth, no individual project is expected to be material to cash flows or results of operations over the next five years. Factors considered included research and development expenses projected to be incurred for the project over the next year relative to Abbott's total research and development expenses, as well as qualitative factors, such as marketplace perceptions and impact of a new product on Abbott's overall market position. There were no delays in Abbott's 2017 research and development activities that are expected to have a material impact on operations.
research and development
While the aggregate cost to complete the numerous projects currently in development is expected to be material, the total cost to complete will depend upon Abbott's ability to successfully complete each project, the rate at which each project advances, and the ultimate timing for completion. Given the potential for significant delays and the risk of failure inherent in the development of pharmaceutical, medical device and diagnostic products and technologies, it is not possible to accurately estimate the total cost to complete all projects currently in development. Abbott plans to manage its portfolio of projects to achieve research and development spending that will be competitive in each of the businesses in which it participates, and such spending is expected to approximate 7.5 percent of total Abbott sales in 2018. Abbott does not regularly accumulate or make management decisions based on the total expenses incurred for a particular development phase in a given period.
research and development
Capital expenditures of $1.1 billion in 2017, 2016 and 2015 were principally for upgrading and expanding manufacturing and research and development facilities and equipment in various segments, investments in information technology, and laboratory instruments placed with customers.

In August 2015, Abbott completed the acquisition of the equity of Tendyne Holdings, Inc. (Tendyne) that Abbott did not already own for approximately $225 million in cash plus additional payments up to $150 million to be made upon completion of certain regulatory milestones. The acquisition of Tendyne, which is focused on developing minimally invasive mitral valve replacement therapies, allows Abbott to broaden its foundation in the treatment of mitral valve disease. The final allocation of the fair value of the acquisition resulted in non-deductible acquired in-process research and development of approximately $220 million, which is accounted for as an indefinite-lived intangible asset until regulatory approval or discontinuation, non-deductible goodwill of approximately $142 million, deferred tax assets and other net assets of approximately $18 million, deferred tax liabilities of approximately $85 million, and contingent consideration of approximately $70 million. The goodwill is identifiable to the Cardiovascular and Neuromodulation Products segment. If the acquisition of Tendyne had taken place as of the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period, consolidated net sales and earnings would not have been significantly different from reported amounts.
research and development
Indefinite-lived intangible assets, which relate to in-process research and development acquired in a business combination, were approximately $3.9 billion and $349 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. In 2017, in-process research and development increased by $4.5 billion due to the completion of the St. Jude Medical and Alere acquisitions, a portion of which became amortizable during the year. In 2017, Abbott also recorded a $53 million impairment of an in-process research and development project related to the Cardiovascular and Neuromodulation Products segment. In 2016, Abbott recorded an impairment of a $59 million in-process research and development project related to a non-reportable segment. Foreign currency translation increased intangible assets by $227 million in 2017 and $6 million in 2016.

From 2014 to 2017, Abbott management approved plans to streamline operations in order to reduce costs and improve efficiencies in various Abbott businesses including the nutritional, established pharmaceuticals and vascular businesses. Abbott recorded employee related severance and other charges of approximately $120 million in 2017, $33 million in 2016, and $95 million in 2015. Approximately $7 million in 2017, $9 million in 2016 and $18 million in 2015 are recorded in Cost of products sold, approximately $77 million in 2017, $5 million in 2016 and $34 million in 2015 are recorded in Research and development and approximately $36 million in 2017, $19 million in 2016 and $43 million in 2015 are recorded in Selling, general and administrative expense. Additional charges of approximately $2 million in 2017, $2 million in 2016 and $45 million in 2015 were recorded primarily for accelerated depreciation. The following summarizes the activity for these restructurings:

Abbott's research and development efforts may not succeed in developing commercially successful products and technologies, which may cause Abbott's revenue and profitability to decline.
research and development
To remain competitive, Abbott must continue to launch new products and technologies. To accomplish this, Abbott commits substantial efforts, funds, and other resources to research and development. A high rate of failure is inherent in the research and development of new products and technologies. Abbott must make ongoing substantial expenditures without any assurance that its efforts will be commercially successful. Failure can occur at any point in the process, including after significant funds have been invested.

Abbott's research and development facilities in the United States are primarily located in California, Illinois, New Jersey, and Ohio. Abbott also has research and development facilities in various other countries including China, Colombia, India, Singapore, and Spain.
research and development
 Abbott has acquired and continues to acquire significant intangible assets that Abbott records at fair value at the acquisition date. Transactions involving the purchase or sale of intangible assets occur with some frequency between companies in the health care field and valuations are usually based on a discounted cash flow analysis. The discounted cash flow model requires assumptions about the timing and amount of future net cash flows, risk, cost of capital, terminal values and market participants. Each of these factors can significantly affect the value of the intangible asset. Abbott engages independent valuation experts who review Abbott's critical assumptions and calculations for acquisitions of significant intangibles. Abbott reviews definite-lived intangible assets for impairment each quarter using an undiscounted net cash flows approach. If the undiscounted cash flows of an intangible asset are less than the carrying value of an intangible asset, the intangible asset is written down to its fair value, which is usually the discounted cash flow amount. Where cash flows cannot be identified for an individual asset, the review is applied at the lowest group level for which cash flows are identifiable. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, which relate to in-process research and development acquired in a business combination, are reviewed for impairment annually or when an event that could result in impairment occurs. At December 31, 2016, goodwill amounted to $7.7 billion and intangibles amounted to $4.5 billion, excluding approximately $2.0 billion of goodwill and $529 million of intangibles in Non-current assets held for disposition due to the pending sale of AMO. Amortization expense in continuing operations for intangible assets amounted to $550 million in 2016, $601 million in 2015 and $555 million in 2014. There were no impairments of goodwill in 2016, 2015 or 2014.
research and development
Research and development expense was $1.422 billion in 2016, $1.405 billion in 2015, and $1.345 billion in 2014 and represented a 1.2 percent increase in 2016, and a 4.5 percent increase in 2015. The 2016 increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to higher spending on various projects and the impairment of an in-process research and development asset related to a non-reportable segment, partially offset by lower restructuring costs in 2016. In 2016, research and development expenditures totaled $513 million for the Diagnostics Products segment, $259 million for the Vascular Products segment, $205 million for the Nutritional Products segment, and $137 million for the Established Pharmaceutical Products segment.

In December 2014, Abbott completed the acquisition of Topera, Inc. for approximately $250 million in cash, plus additional payments up to $300 million to be made upon completion of certain regulatory and sales milestones. The acquisition of Topera provides Abbott a foundational entry in the electrophysiology market. The final allocation of the fair value of the acquisition resulted in non-deductible acquired in-process research and development of approximately $60 million, which is accounted for as an indefinite-lived intangible asset until regulatory approval or discontinuation, non-deductible definite-lived intangible assets of approximately $215 million, non-deductible goodwill of approximately $145 million, net deferred tax liabilities of approximately $80 million, and contingent consideration of approximately $90 million. The fair value of the contingent consideration was determined based on an independent appraisal. Acquired intangible assets consist of developed technology and trademarks, and are being amortized over 17 years.

In 2013, Abbott management also approved plans to streamline certain manufacturing operations in order to reduce costs and improve efficiencies in Abbott's established pharmaceuticals business. In 2012, Abbott management approved plans to streamline various commercial operations in order to reduce costs and improve efficiencies in Abbott's core diagnostics, established pharmaceuticals and nutritionals businesses. Abbott recorded employee-related severance charges of approximately $66 million in 2015, $125 million in 2014 and $78 million in 2013. Approximately $9 million in 2015, $7 million in 2014 and $14 million in 2013 are recorded in Cost of products sold, approximately $2 million in 2015 and $6 million in 2014 are recorded in Research and development, and approximately $55 million in 2015, $112 million in 2014 and $32 million in 2013 are recorded in Selling, general and administrative expense. The remaining charge of $32 million in 2013 is related to Abbott's developed market established pharmaceutical business and is being recognized in the results of discontinued operations. Additional charges of approximately $4 million in 2013 were also recorded primarily for accelerated depreciation.

In 2013 and prior years, Abbott management approved plans to streamline global manufacturing operations, reduce overall costs and improve efficiencies in its worldwide pharmaceutical, vascular and core diagnostics businesses as well as selected domestic and international commercial and research and development operations. Abbott recorded charges for employee severance as well as for the impairment of manufacturing facilities and other assets. In 2013 Abbott recorded employee severance charges of approximately $11 million which was classified as cost of products sold. An additional $41 million was recorded in 2013 relating to these restructurings, primarily for accelerated depreciation.
r&d
The income tax rates on earnings from continuing operations were 18.1 percent in 2015, 31.6 percent in 2014 and 2.6 percent in 2013. In 2015, taxes on earnings from continuing operations includes $71 million of tax expense related to gain on the disposal of shares of Mylan N.V. stock. The 2015 effective tax rate includes the impact of the R&D tax credit that was made permanent in the U.S. by the Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015. In 2014, taxes on earnings from continuing operations include $440 million of tax expense associated with a one-time repatriation of 2014 non-U.S. earnings partially offset by $125 million of tax benefits related to the resolution of various tax positions and the adjustment of tax uncertainties from prior years. 2013 taxes on earnings from continuing operations include $230 million of tax benefit related to the resolution of various tax positions from previous years. In addition, as a result of the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 signed into law in January 2013, Abbott recorded a tax benefit to taxes on continuing operations of approximately $103 million in 2013 for the retroactive extension of the research tax credit and the look-through rules of section 954(c)(6) of the Internal Revenue Code to the beginning of 2012.

Research and Development Process
research and development
In the Diagnostics segment, the phases of the research and development process include:
research and development
In the Vascular segment, the research and development process begins with research on a specific technology that is evaluated for feasibility and commercial viability. If the research program passes that hurdle, it moves forward into development. The development process includes evaluation and selection of a product design, completion of clinical trials to test the product's safety and efficacy, and validation of the manufacturing process to demonstrate its repeatability and ability to consistently meet pre-determined specifications.
research and development
In the Nutritional segment, the research and development process generally focuses on identifying and developing ingredients and products that address the nutritional needs of particular populations (e.g., infants, athletes) or patients (e.g., people with diabetes). Depending upon the country and/or region, if claims regarding a product's efficacy will be made, clinical studies typically must be conducted.
research and development
Nutrition  Abbott is focusing its research and development spend on platforms that span the pediatric, adult and performance nutrition areas: gastro intestinal health, brain health, mobility and metabolism, and user experience platforms. Numerous new products that build on advances in these platforms are currently under development, including clinical outcome testing, and are expected to be launched over the coming years.
research and development
Given the diversity of Abbott's business, its intention to remain a broad-based healthcare company and the numerous sources for potential future growth, no individual project is expected to be material to cash flows or results of operations over the next five years. Factors considered included research and development expenses projected to be incurred for the project over the next year relative to Abbott's total research and development expenses as well as qualitative factors, such as marketplace perceptions and impact of a new product on Abbott's overall market position. There were no delays in Abbott's 2015 research and development activities that are expected to have a material impact on operations.
research and development
While the aggregate cost to complete the numerous projects currently in development is expected to be material, the total cost to complete will depend upon Abbott's ability to successfully complete each project, the rate at which each project advances, and the ultimate timing for completion. Given the potential for significant delays and the high rate of failure inherent in the development of pharmaceutical, medical device and diagnostic products and technologies, it is not possible to accurately estimate the total cost to complete all projects currently in development. Abbott plans to manage its portfolio of projects to achieve research and development spending equal to approximately 6 percent to 7 percent of sales each

In August 2015, Abbott completed the acquisition of the equity of Tendyne Holdings, Inc. (Tendyne) that Abbott did not already own for approximately $225 million in cash plus additional payments up to $150 million to be made upon completion of certain regulatory milestones. The acquisition of Tendyne, which is focused on developing minimally invasive mitral valve replacement therapies, allows Abbott to broaden its foundation in the treatment of mitral valve disease. The preliminary allocation of the fair value of the acquisition resulted in non-deductible acquired in-process research and development of approximately $220 million, which is accounted for as an indefinite-lived intangible asset until regulatory approval or discontinuation, non-deductible goodwill of approximately $142 million, other assets of approximately $13 million, net deferred tax liabilities of approximately $80 million, and contingent consideration of approximately $70 million. The preliminary allocations of the fair value of the above acquisition will be finalized when the valuation is completed.

The gross amount of amortizable intangible assets, primarily product rights and technology was $10.8 billion and $11.0 billion as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and accumulated amortization was $5.7 billion and $4.9 billion as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The December 31, 2014 amounts exclude the intangibles that were classified as held for disposition. Indefinite-lived intangible assets, which relate to in-process research and development acquired in a business combination, were approximately $419 million and $134 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Foreign currency translation decreased intangible assets, net of amortization, in 2015 and 2014 by $251 million and $396 million, respectively. In 2015, the acquisition of Tendyne increased intangible assets by approximately $220 million. In 2014, the acquisition of CFR Pharmaceuticals increased intangible assets by approximately $1.8 billion. Approximately $804 million of net intangible assets related to the developed markets branded generics pharmaceuticals businesses was reclassified to Non-current assets held for disposition due to the planned disposition of this business.

Abbott's research and development efforts may not succeed in developing commercially successful products and technologies, which may cause Abbott's revenue and profitability to decline.
research and development
To remain competitive, Abbott must continue to launch new products and technologies. To accomplish this, Abbott commits substantial efforts, funds, and other resources to research and development. A high rate of failure is inherent in the research and development of new products and technologies. Abbott must make ongoing substantial expenditures without any assurance that its efforts will be commercially successful. Failure can occur at any point in the process, including after significant funds have been invested.

the carrying value of an intangible asset, the intangible asset is written down to its fair value, which is usually the discounted cash flow amount. Where cash flows cannot be identified for an individual asset, the review is applied at the lowest group level for which cash flows are identifiable. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, which relate to in-process research and development acquired in a business combination, are reviewed for impairment annually or when an event that could result in impairment occurs. At December 31, 2014, goodwill amounted to $10.1 billion and intangibles amounted to $6.2 billion, and amortization expense in continuing operations for intangible assets amounted to $555 million in 2014, $588 million in 2013 and $595 million in 2012. There were no impairments of goodwill in 2014, 2013 or 2012. In 2012, Abbott recorded impairment charges of $69 million for certain research and development assets due to changes in the projected development and regulatory timelines for the projects.
research and development
Research and development expense was $1.345 billion in 2014, $1.371 billion in 2013, and $1.461 billion in 2012 and represented a 1.9 percent decrease in 2014, and a 6.2 percent decrease in 2013. The 2014 decrease in research and development expenses primarily reflects lower investment due to the completion of several programs in the Vascular business. In 2014, research and development expenditures totaled $268 million for the Vascular Products segment, $432 million for the Diagnostics Products segment, $129 million for the Established Pharmaceutical Products segment, and $191 million for the Nutritional Products segment.

Nutrition  Abbott is focusing its research and development spend on six platforms that span the pediatric, adult and performance nutrition areas: immunity, cognition, lean body mass, inflammation, metabolism and tolerance. Numerous new products that build on advances in these platforms are currently under development, including clinical outcome testing, and are expected to be launched over the coming years.
research and development
Given the diversity of Abbott's business, its intention to remain a broad-based healthcare company and the numerous sources for potential future growth, no individual project is expected to be material to cash flows or results of operations over the next five years. Factors considered included research and development expenses projected to be incurred for the project over the next year relative to Abbott's total research and development expenses as well as qualitative factors, such as marketplace perceptions and impact of a new product on Abbott's overall market position. There were no delays in Abbott's 2014 research and development activities that are expected to have a material impact on operations.
research and development
While the aggregate cost to complete the numerous projects currently in development is expected to be material, the total cost to complete will depend upon Abbott's ability to successfully complete each project, the rate at which each project advances, and the ultimate timing for completion. Given the potential for significant delays and the high rate of failure inherent in the development of pharmaceutical, medical device and diagnostic products and technologies, it is not possible to accurately estimate the total cost to complete all projects currently in development. Abbott plans to manage its portfolio of projects to achieve research and development spending equal to approximately 6 percent to 7 percent of sales each year. Abbott does not regularly accumulate or make management decisions based on the total expenses incurred for a particular development phase in a given period.

Transactions involving the purchase or sale of intangible assets occur with some frequency between companies in the health care field and valuations are usually based on a discounted cash flow analysis. The discounted cash flow model requires assumptions about the timing and amount of future net cash flows, risk, the cost of capital, terminal values and market participants. Each of these factors can significantly affect the value of the intangible asset. Abbott engages independent valuation experts who review Abbott's critical assumptions and calculations for acquisitions of significant intangibles. Abbott reviews definite-lived intangible assets for impairment each quarter using an undiscounted net cash flows approach. If the undiscounted cash flows of an intangible asset are less than the carrying value of an intangible asset, the intangible asset is written down to its fair value, which is usually the discounted cash flow amount. Where cash flows cannot be identified for an individual asset, the review is applied at the lowest group level for which cash flows are identifiable. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, which relate to in-process research and development acquired in a business combination, are reviewed for impairment annually or when an event that could result in an impairment occurs. At December 31, 2013, goodwill amounted to $9.8 billion and intangibles amounted to $5.7 billion, and amortization expense for intangible assets amounted to $791 million in 2013, $795 million in 2012 and $884 million in 2011. There were no impairments of goodwill in 2013, 2012 or 2011. In 2012 and 2011, Abbott recorded impairment charges of $69 million and $125 million, respectively, for certain research and development assets due to changes in the projected development and regulatory timelines for the projects.
research and development
Research and development expense was $1.452 billion in 2013, $1.544 billion in 2012 and $1.512 billion in 2011 and represented a 6.0 percent decrease in 2013, and a 2.1 percent increase in 2012. The 2013 decrease primarily reflects the incurrence of restructuring and asset impairment charges in 2012 which did not recur in 2013. In 2013, research and development expenditures totaled $336 million for the Vascular Products segment, $416 million for the Diagnostics Products segment, $239 million for the Established Pharmaceutical Products segment and $188 million for the Nutritional Products segment.

In August 2013, Abbott acquired 100 percent of IDEV Technologies, net of debt, for $310 million, in cash. The acquisition of IDEV Technologies expands Abbott's endovascular portfolio. The allocation of the fair value of the acquisition resulted in non-deductible acquired in-process research and development of approximately $170 million which is accounted for as an indefinite-lived intangible asset until regulatory approval or discontinuation, non-deductible definite-lived intangible assets of approximately $66 million, non-deductible goodwill of approximately $123 million and net deferred tax liabilities of $56 million. Acquired intangible assets consist of developed technology and are being amortized over 11 years.

In August 2013, Abbott acquired 100 percent of OptiMedica for $260 million, in cash, plus additional payments up to $150 million to be made upon completion of certain development, regulatory and sales milestones. The acquisition of OptiMedica provides Abbott with an immediate entry point into the laser assisted cataract surgery market. The allocation of the fair value of the acquisition resulted in non-deductible definite-lived intangible assets of approximately $160 million, non-deductible acquired in-process research and development of approximately $60 million which is accounted for as an indefinite-lived intangible asset until regulatory approval or discontinuation, non-deductible goodwill of approximately $151 million, net deferred tax liabilities of $70 million and contingent consideration of approximately $70 million. The fair value of the contingent consideration was determined based on an independent appraisal. Acquired intangible assets consist primarily of developed technology that is being amortized over 18 years.
research and development
In 2013 and prior years, Abbott management approved plans to realign its worldwide pharmaceutical and vascular manufacturing operations and selected domestic and international commercial and research and development operations in order to reduce costs. In 2013, Abbott recorded employee severance charges of approximately $11 million. In 2011, Abbott recorded charges of approximately $194 million reflecting the impairment of manufacturing facilities and other assets, employee severance and other related charges. Approximately $11 million in 2013 and $18 million in 2011 is classified as Cost of products sold. The remaining 2011 charge of $176 million related to businesses transferred to AbbVie and is being recognized in the results of discontinued operations. An additional $41 million, $110 million and $25 million were recorded in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively, relating to these restructurings, primarily for accelerated depreciation.
research and development
In 2012, Abbott recorded a charge of approximately $150 million for employee severance and contractual obligations, primarily related to the exit from a research and development facility. These charges related to businesses transferred to AbbVie and have been recognized in the results of discontinued operations.

Research and Development Process
research and development
In the Diagnostics segment, the phases of the research and development process include:
research and development
In the Vascular segment, the research and development process begins with research on a specific technology that is evaluated for feasibility and commercial viability. If the research program passes that hurdle, it moves forward into development. The development process includes evaluation and selection of a product design, completion of clinical trials to test the product's safety and efficacy, and validation of the manufacturing process to demonstrate its repeatability and ability to consistently meet pre-determined specifications.
research and development
In the Nutritional segment, the research and development process generally focuses on identifying and developing ingredients and products that address the nutritional needs of particular populations (e.g., infants, athletes) or patients (e.g., people with diabetes). Depending upon the country and/or region, if claims regarding a product's efficacy will be made, clinical studies typically must be conducted. Most other product development, such as a product form change from liquid to powder, generally does not necessitate clinical studies.
research and development
Nutrition  Abbott is focusing its research and development spend on six benefit platforms that span the pediatric, adult and performance nutrition areas: immunity, cognition, lean body mass, inflammation, metabolism and tolerance. Numerous new products that build on advances in these benefit platforms are currently under development, including clinical outcome testing, and are expected to be launched over the coming years.
research and development
Given the diversity of Abbott's business, its intention to remain a broad-based healthcare company and the numerous sources for potential future growth, no individual project is expected to be material to cash flows or results of operations over the next five years. Factors considered included research and development expenses projected to be incurred for the project over the next year relative to Abbott's total research and development expenses as well as qualitative factors, such as marketplace perceptions and impact of a new product on Abbott's overall market position. There were no delays in Abbott's 2013 research and development activities that are expected to have a material impact on operations.
research and development
While the aggregate cost to complete the numerous projects currently in development is expected to be material, the total cost to complete will depend upon Abbott's ability to successfully complete each project, the rate at which each project advances, and the ultimate timing for completion. Given the potential for significant delays and the high rate of failure inherent in the development of pharmaceutical and medical device products and technologies, it is not possible to accurately estimate the total cost to complete all projects currently in development. Abbott plans to manage its portfolio of projects to achieve research and development spend equal to approximately 6 percent to 7 percent of sales each year. Abbott does not regularly accumulate or make management decisions based on the total expenses incurred for a particular development phase in a given period.
research and development
Capital expenditures of $1.1 billion in 2013, $1.8 billion in 2012 and $1.5 billion in 2011 were principally for upgrading and expanding manufacturing and research and development facilities and equipment in various segments, investments in information technology, and laboratory instruments placed with customers. The 2013 decrease reflects the separation of AbbVie at the beginning of 2013.

In August 2013, Abbott acquired 100 percent of OptiMedica for $260 million, in cash, plus additional payments up to $150 million to be made upon completion of certain development, regulatory and sales milestones. The acquisition of OptiMedica provides Abbott with an immediate entry point into the laser assisted cataract surgery market. The allocation of the fair value of the acquisition resulted in non-deductible definite-lived intangible assets of approximately $160 million; non-deductible acquired in-process research and development of approximately $60 million, which is accounted for as an indefinite-lived intangible asset until regulatory approval or discontinuation; non-deductible goodwill of approximately $151 million, net deferred tax liabilities of $70 million and contingent consideration of approximately $70 million. The fair value of the contingent consideration was determined based on an independent appraisal. Acquired intangible assets consist primarily of developed technology that is being amortized over 18 years.
research and development
The gross amount of amortizable intangible assets, primarily product rights and technology was $12.2 billion and $17.6 billion as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively, and accumulated amortization was $6.8 billion and $9.7 billion as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Indefinite-lived intangible assets, which relate to in-process research and development acquired in a business combination, were approximately $266 million and $691 million at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Gross amortizable intangible assets, accumulated amortization and indefinite-lived intangible assets of $5.7 billion, $3.8 billion and $417 million, respectively, were transferred to AbbVie as part of the separation on January 1, 2013. In 2012 and 2011, Abbott recorded impairment charges of $69 million and $125 million, respectively, for certain research and development assets due to changes in the projected development and regulatory timelines for the projects. The charges relate to non-reportable segments. Discounted cash flow analysis was used to analyze fair value and the charges are included in research and development expenses.

Abbott spent approximately $4.3 billion in 2012, $4.1 billion in 2011, and $3.7 billion in 2010, on research to discover and develop new products and processes and to improve existing products and processes. The majority of research and development expenditures was concentrated on proprietary pharmaceutical products.
research and development
Abbott's research and development efforts may not succeed in developing commercially successful products and technologies, which may cause Abbott's revenue and profitability to decline.
research and development
To remain competitive, Abbott must continue to launch new products and technologies. To accomplish this, Abbott commits substantial efforts, funds, and other resources to research and development. A high rate of failure is inherent in the research and development of new products and technologies. Abbott must make ongoing substantial expenditures without any assurance that its efforts will be commercially successful. Failure can occur at any point in the process, including after significant funds have been invested.
research and development
After the separation of AbbVie, Abbott's research and development facilities in the United States are primarily located in California, Illinois, New Jersey, and Ohio. Abbott also has research and development facilities in various other countries including Germany, Netherlands, Singapore, Spain, and the United Kingdom. Prior to the separation of AbbVie, research and development related to the Proprietary Pharmaceutical Products segment was carried out in various locations including California, Illinois and Massachusetts in the United States, Germany, and Japan.
research and development
Pharmaceutical research and development was focused over the last three years on therapeutic areas that included immunology, oncology, neuroscience, pain management, hepatitis C (HCV), chronic kidney disease and women's health. In addition, Abbott acquired the rights to various in-process pharmaceutical research and development projects including the development of second-generation oral antioxidant inflammation modulators and an oral, next-generation JAK1 inhibitor with the potential to treat multiple autoimmune diseases.

There were no impairments of goodwill in 2012, 2011 or 2010. In 2012 and 2011, Abbott recorded impairment charges of $82 million and $174 million, respectively, for certain research and development assets due to changes in the projected development and regulatory timelines for the projects.
research and development
Research and development expense was $4.322 billion in 2012, $4.129 billion in 2011 and $3.724 billion in 2010 and represented increases of 4.7 percent in 2012, 10.9 percent in 2011 and 35.7 percent in 2010. Excluding charges related to the Solvay restructurings announced in September 2010, research and development expense increased 6.2 percent in 2011 and 29.4 percent in 2010. The 2010 increase, exclusive of the effects of the restructuring charges, reflects the acquisitions of Solvay's pharmaceuticals business in February 2010 and Facet Biotech in April 2010. The increases in 2012, 2011 and 2010 also reflect continued pipeline spending, including programs in biologics, hepatitis C and diagnostics. The majority of research and development expenditures over the three years were

Research and Development Process
research and development
In the Proprietary Pharmaceuticals segment, the research and development process generally begins with discovery research which focuses on the identification of a molecule that has a desired effect against a given disease. If preclinical testing of an identified compound proves successful, the compound moves into clinical development which generally includes the following phases:
research and development
The research and development process from discovery through a new drug launch typically takes 8 - 12 years and can be even longer. There is a significant amount of uncertainty inherent in the research and development of new pharmaceutical products and there is no guarantee when, or if, a molecule will receive the regulatory approval required to launch a new drug or indication.
research and development
In addition to the development of new products and new formulations, proprietary pharmaceutical research and development projects also may include Phase IV trials, sometimes called post-marketing studies. For such projects, clinical trials are designed and conducted to collect additional data regarding, among other parameters, the benefits and risks of an approved drug.

In February 2010, Abbott acquired Solvay's pharmaceuticals business (Solvay Pharmaceuticals) for approximately $6.1 billion, in cash, plus additional payments of up to EUR 100 million per year if certain sales milestones are met in 2011, 2012 and 2013. Contingent consideration of approximately $290 million was recorded. The acquisition of Solvay Pharmaceuticals provided Abbott with a large and complementary portfolio of pharmaceutical products and expands Abbott's presence in key global emerging markets. Abbott acquired control of this business on February 15, 2010 and the financial results of the acquired operations are included in these financial statements beginning on that date. Net sales for the acquired operations for 2010 were approximately $3.1 billion. Pretax loss of the acquired operations, including acquisition, integration and restructuring expenses, for 2010 was approximately $395 million. The acquisition was funded with cash and short-term investments. The allocation of the fair value of the acquisition resulted in the recording of $2.2 billion of non-deductible goodwill, $4.1 billion of non-deductible intangible assets, $500 million of non-deductible acquired in-process research and development assets, net tangible assets of $700 million and deferred income taxes of $1.1 billion. Acquired intangible assets consist primarily of product rights for currently marketed products and are amortized over 2 to 14 years (average of 11 years). Acquired in-process research and development projects are accounted for as indefinite lived intangible assets until regulatory approval or discontinuation. The net tangible assets acquired consist primarily of trade accounts receivable of approximately $675 million, inventory of approximately $390 million, property and equipment of approximately $725 million, net of assumed liabilities, primarily trade accounts payable, accrued compensation and other liabilities.

Abbott's Proprietary Pharmaceutical Products segment has entered into various collaboration research and development agreements. In 2012, Abbott acquired AP214, a drug under development for the prevention of acute kidney injury associated with major cardiac surgery in patients at increased risk, and as a result of this transaction, Abbott recorded a charge to acquired in-process and collaborations research and development of $110 million. In addition, in 2012, Abbott entered into a global collaboration to develop and commercialize an oral, next-generation JAK1 inhibitor in Phase II development with the potential to treat multiple autoimmune diseases, and as a result of this transaction Abbott recorded a charge to acquired in-process and collaborations research and development of $150 million. Additional payments of approximately $1.2 billion could be required for the achievement of certain development, regulatory and commercial milestones under this agreement. Under another collaboration, Abbott was granted the rights in 2012 to utilize up to three antibody-drug conjugate compounds and Abbott recorded a charge to acquired in-process and collaborations research and development of $28 million. Additional payments of approximately $220 million for each licensed compound could be required for the achievement of certain development, regulatory and commercial milestones under this agreement. In connection with the acquisition of Solvay Pharmaceuticals, the achievement of a certain sales milestone resulted in a payment of approximately $134 million in the first quarter of 2012 for which a liability was previously established.
research and development
During 2010 and 2011, Abbott entered into a series of transactions with Reata Pharmaceuticals which included (1) a collaboration agreement for the joint development and commercialization of second generation oral antioxidant inflammation modulators resulting in a charge to acquired in-process and collaborations research and development of $400 million in 2011, (2) an agreement to acquire licensing rights outside the U.S., excluding certain Asian markets, to bardoxolone methyl, a product in development for the treatment of chronic kidney disease resulting in a charge to acquired in-process and collaborations research and development of $238 million in 2010 and (3) the acquisition of equity interests in Reata of $62 million each in 2011 and 2010. In 2011, certain milestones were achieved in the development for the treatment of chronic kidney disease and charges to acquired in-process and collaborations research and development of $188 million were recorded. In the first quarter of 2012, $50 million of research and development expense was recorded related to the achievement of a clinical development milestone under the license agreement. The license agreement requires additional payments of up to $150 million if certain development and regulatory milestones associated with the chronic kidney disease compound are achieved.

Research and Development
research and development
Abbott spent approximately $4.3 billion in 2012, $4.1 billion in 2011, and $3.7 billion in 2010, on research to discover and develop new products and processes and to improve existing products and processes. The majority of research and development expenditures was concentrated on proprietary pharmaceutical products.
research and development
Abbott's research and development efforts may not succeed in developing commercially successful products and technologies, which may cause Abbott's revenue and profitability to decline.
research and development
To remain competitive, Abbott must continue to launch new products and technologies. To accomplish this, Abbott commits substantial efforts, funds, and other resources to research and development. A high rate of failure is inherent in the research and development of new products and technologies. Abbott must make ongoing substantial expenditures without any assurance that its efforts will be commercially successful. Failure can occur at any point in the process, including after significant funds have been invested.
research and development
After the separation of AbbVie, Abbott's research and development facilities in the United States are primarily located in California, Illinois, New Jersey, and Ohio. Abbott also has research and development facilities in various other countries including Germany, Netherlands, Singapore, Spain, and the United Kingdom. Prior to the separation of AbbVie, research and development related to the Proprietary Pharmaceutical Products segment was carried out in various locations including California, Illinois and Massachusetts in the United States, Germany, and Japan.
research and development
Pharmaceutical research and development was focused over the last three years on therapeutic areas that included immunology, oncology, neuroscience, pain management, hepatitis C (HCV), chronic kidney disease and women's health. In addition, Abbott acquired the rights to various in-process pharmaceutical research and development projects including the development of second-generation oral antioxidant inflammation modulators and an oral, next-generation JAK1 inhibitor with the potential to treat multiple autoimmune diseases.
research and development
 Abbott has acquired and continues to acquire significant intangible assets that Abbott records at fair value. Transactions involving the purchase or sale of intangible assets occur with some frequency between companies in the health care field and valuations are usually based on a discounted cash flow analysis. The discounted cash flow model requires assumptions about the timing and amount of future net cash flows, risk, the cost of capital, terminal values and market participants. Each of these factors can significantly affect the value of the intangible asset. Abbott engages independent valuation experts who review Abbott's critical assumptions and calculations for acquisitions of significant intangibles. Abbott reviews definite-lived intangible assets for impairment each quarter using an undiscounted net cash flows approach. If the undiscounted cash flows of an intangible asset are less than the carrying value of an intangible asset, the intangible asset is written down to its fair value, which is usually the discounted cash flow amount. Where cash flows cannot be identified for an individual asset, the review is applied at the lowest group level for which cash flows are identifiable. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, which relate to in-process research and development acquired in a business combination, are reviewed for impairment annually or when an event that could result in an impairment occurs. At December 31, 2012, goodwill and intangibles amounted to $15.8 billion and $8.6 billion, respectively, and amortization expense for intangible assets amounted to $1.4 billion in 2012. There were no impairments of goodwill in 2012, 2011 or 2010. In 2012 and 2011, Abbott recorded impairment charges of $82 million and $174 million, respectively, for certain research and development assets due to changes in the projected development and regulatory timelines for the projects.
research and development
Research and development expense was $4.322 billion in 2012, $4.129 billion in 2011 and $3.724 billion in 2010 and represented increases of 4.7 percent in 2012, 10.9 percent in 2011 and 35.7 percent in 2010. Excluding charges related to the Solvay restructurings announced in September 2010, research and development expense increased 6.2 percent in 2011 and 29.4 percent in 2010. The 2010 increase, exclusive of the effects of the restructuring charges, reflects the acquisitions of Solvay's pharmaceuticals business in February 2010 and Facet Biotech in April 2010. The increases in 2012, 2011 and 2010 also reflect continued pipeline spending, including programs in biologics, hepatitis C and diagnostics. The majority of research and development expenditures over the three years were

In 2011 and prior years, Abbott management approved plans to realign its worldwide pharmaceutical and vascular manufacturing operations and selected domestic and international commercial and research and development operations in order to reduce costs. In 2011 and 2010, Abbott recorded charges of approximately $194 million and $56 million, respectively, reflecting the impairment of manufacturing facilities and other assets, employee severance and other related charges. Approximately $76 million in 2011 is classified as Cost of products sold, $69 million as Research and development and $49 million as Selling, general and administrative. Approximately $56 million in 2010 is classified as Cost of products sold. The following summarizes the activity for these restructurings:

In 2012 and 2010, Abbott management approved restructuring plans primarily related to the acquisition of Solvay's pharmaceuticals business. These plans streamline operations, improve efficiencies and reduce costs in certain Solvay sites and functions as well as in certain Abbott and Solvay commercial organizations in various countries. In 2012, Abbott recorded a charge of approximately $150 million for employee severance and contractual obligations, primarily related to the exit from a research and development facility. Approximately $142 million is recorded as Research and development and $8 million as Selling, general and administrative. In 2010, Abbott recorded charges to Cost of products sold, Research and development and Selling, general and administrative of approximately $99 million, $152 million and $272 million, respectively.

Research and Development Process
research and development
In the Proprietary Pharmaceuticals segment, the research and development process generally begins with discovery research which focuses on the identification of a molecule that has a desired effect against a given disease. If preclinical testing of an identified compound proves successful, the compound moves into clinical development which generally includes the following phases:
research and development
The research and development process from discovery through a new drug launch typically takes 8 - 12 years and can be even longer. There is a significant amount of uncertainty inherent in the research and development of new pharmaceutical products and there is no guarantee when, or if, a molecule will receive the regulatory approval required to launch a new drug or indication.
research and development
In addition to the development of new products and new formulations, proprietary pharmaceutical research and development projects also may include Phase IV trials, sometimes called post-marketing studies. For such projects, clinical trials are designed and conducted to collect additional data regarding, among other parameters, the benefits and risks of an approved drug.
research and development
In the Diagnostics segment, the phases of the research and development process include:
research and development
In the Vascular segment, the research and development process begins with research on a specific technology that is evaluated for feasibility and commercial viability. If the research program passes that hurdle, it moves forward into development. The development process includes evaluation and selection of a product design, completion of clinical trials to test the product's safety and efficacy, and validation of the manufacturing process to demonstrate its repeatability and ability to consistently meet pre-determined specifications.
research and development
In the Nutritional segment, the research and development process generally focuses on identifying and developing ingredients and products that address the nutritional needs of particular populations (e.g., infants, athletes) or patients (e.g., people with diabetes). Depending upon the country and/or region, if claims regarding a product's efficacy will be made, clinical studies typically must be conducted. Most other product development, such as a product form change from liquid to powder, generally does not necessitate clinical studies.
r&d
blood glucose monitoring system that includes a touch-screen interface and other features designed to support the insulin-using patient. After receiving CE Mark for this system in May 2011 and Health Canada approval in October 2011, Abbott is continuing to provide R&D support as the product is launched in additional markets. Development is also continuing on an updated hospital blood glucose monitoring system for which a filing for approval is projected to be submitted in the U.S. during the first half of 2013. Abbott is also developing a next-generation monitoring system under the Precision product platform and for which Abbott anticipates submitting filings for approval in various markets in the second half of 2013.
research and development
Nutrition  Abbott is focusing its research and development spend on six benefit platforms that span the pediatric, adult and performance nutrition areas: immunity, cognition, lean body mass, inflammation, metabolism and tolerance. Numerous new products that build on advances in these benefit platforms are currently under development and are expected to be launched over the coming years.
research and development
Given the diversity of Abbott's business, its intention to remain a broad-based healthcare company and the numerous sources for potential future growth, no individual project is expected to be material to cash flows or results of operations over the next five years. Factors considered included research and development expenses projected to be incurred for the project over the next year relative to Abbott's total research and development expenses as well as qualitative factors, such as marketplace perceptions and impact of a new product on Abbott's overall market position. There were no delays in Abbott's 2012 research and development activities that are expected to have a material impact on operations.
research and development
While the aggregate cost to complete the numerous projects currently in development is expected to be material, the total cost to complete will depend upon Abbott's ability to successfully complete each project, the rate at which each project advances, and the ultimate timing for completion. Given the potential for significant delays and the high rate of failure inherent in the research and development of new pharmaceutical and medical device products and technologies, it is not possible to accurately estimate the total cost to complete all projects currently in development. After the separation of AbbVie, Abbott plans to manage its portfolio of projects to achieve research and development spend equal to approximately 6 percent to 7 percent of sales each year. Abbott does not regularly accumulate or make management decisions based on the total expenses incurred for a particular development phase in a given period.
research and development
In February 2010, Abbott acquired Solvay's pharmaceuticals business (Solvay Pharmaceuticals) for approximately $6.1 billion, in cash, plus additional payments of up to EUR 100 million per year if certain sales milestones are met in 2011, 2012 and 2013. Contingent consideration of approximately $290 million was recorded. The acquisition of Solvay Pharmaceuticals provided Abbott with a large and complementary portfolio of pharmaceutical products and expands Abbott's presence in key global emerging markets. Abbott acquired control of this business on February 15, 2010 and the financial results of the acquired operations are included in these financial statements beginning on that date. Net sales for the acquired operations for 2010 were approximately $3.1 billion. Pretax loss of the acquired operations, including acquisition, integration and restructuring expenses, for 2010 was approximately $395 million. The acquisition was funded with cash and short-term investments. The allocation of the fair value of the acquisition resulted in the recording of $2.2 billion of non-deductible goodwill, $4.1 billion of non-deductible intangible assets, $500 million of non-deductible acquired in-process research and development assets, net tangible assets of $700 million and deferred income taxes of $1.1 billion. Acquired intangible assets consist primarily of product rights for currently marketed products and are amortized over 2 to 14 years (average of 11 years). Acquired in-process research and development projects are accounted for as indefinite lived intangible assets until regulatory approval or discontinuation. The net tangible assets acquired consist primarily of trade accounts receivable of approximately $675 million, inventory of approximately $390 million, property and equipment of approximately $725 million, net of assumed liabilities, primarily trade accounts payable, accrued compensation and other liabilities.

In March 2010, Abbott acquired STARLIMS Technologies for approximately $100 million, in cash, net of cash held by STARLIMS, providing Abbott with leading products and expertise to build its position in laboratory informatics. A substantial portion of the fair value of the acquisition has been allocated to goodwill and amortizable intangible assets. In April 2010, Abbott acquired the outstanding shares of Facet Biotech Corporation for approximately $430 million, in cash, net of cash held by Facet. The acquisition enhanced Abbott's early- and mid-stage pharmaceutical pipeline, including a biologic for multiple sclerosis and compounds that complement Abbott's oncology program. A substantial portion of the fair value of the acquisition was allocated to acquired in-process research and development that is accounted for as an indefinite-lived intangible asset until regulatory approval or discontinuation.

Abbott's Proprietary Pharmaceutical Products segment has entered into various collaboration research and development agreements. In 2012, Abbott acquired AP214, a drug under development for the prevention of acute kidney injury associated with major cardiac surgery in patients at increased risk, and as a result of this transaction, Abbott recorded a charge to acquired in-process and collaborations research and development of $110 million. In addition, in 2012, Abbott entered into a global collaboration to develop and commercialize an oral, next-generation JAK1 inhibitor in Phase II development with the potential to treat multiple autoimmune diseases, and as a result of this transaction Abbott recorded a charge to acquired in-process and collaborations research and development of $150 million. Additional payments of approximately $1.2 billion could be required for the achievement of certain development, regulatory and commercial milestones under this agreement. Under another collaboration, Abbott was granted the rights in 2012 to utilize up to three antibody-drug conjugate compounds and Abbott recorded a charge to acquired in-process and collaborations research and development of $28 million. Additional payments of approximately $220 million for each licensed compound could be required for the achievement of certain development, regulatory and commercial milestones under this agreement. In connection with the acquisition of Solvay Pharmaceuticals, the achievement of a certain sales milestone resulted in a payment of approximately $134 million in the first quarter of 2012 for which a liability was previously established.

In the Diagnostics segment, the phases of the research and development process include:
research and development
In the Vascular segment, the research and development process begins with research on a specific technology that is evaluated for feasibility and commercial viability. If the research program passes that hurdle, it moves forward into development. The development process includes evaluation and selection of a product design, completion of clinical trials to test the product's safety and efficacy, and validation of the manufacturing process to demonstrate its repeatability and ability to consistently meet pre-determined specifications.
research and development
In the Nutritional segment, the research and development process generally focuses on identifying and developing ingredients and products that address the nutritional needs of particular populations (e.g., infants, athletes) or patients (e.g., people with diabetes). Depending upon the country and/or region, if claims regarding a product's efficacy will be made, clinical studies typically must be conducted. Most

blood glucose monitoring system that includes new features designed to support the insulin-using patient for regulatory approval in the U.S. in June 2011. After receiving CE Mark for this system in May 2011 and Health Canada approval in October 2011, Abbott is continuing to provide R&D support as the product is launched in additional markets. Development is also continuing on an updated hospital blood glucose monitoring system for which filings for approval are projected to be submitted in the U.S. and Europe during the first half of 2013. Abbott is also developing a next-generation monitoring system under the Precision product platform. Abbott anticipates submitting filings for approval in various markets in 2013.

Nutrition  Abbott is focusing its research and development spend on six benefit platforms that span the pediatric, adult and performance nutrition areas: immunity, cognition, lean body mass, inflammation, metabolism and tolerance. Numerous new products that build on advances in these benefit platforms are currently under development and are expected to be launched in 2012.
research and development
Given the diversity of Abbott's business, its intention to remain a broad-based healthcare company and the numerous sources for potential future growth, no individual project is expected to be material to cash flows or results of operations over the next five years. Factors considered included research and development expenses projected to be incurred for the project (compound or device) over the next year relative to Abbott's total research and development expenses as well as qualitative factors, such as marketplace perceptions and impact of a new product on Abbott's overall market position. There were no delays in Abbott's 2011 research and development activities that are expected to have a material impact on operations.
research and development
While the aggregate cost to complete the numerous pharmaceutical and medical device projects currently in development is expected to be material, the total cost to complete will depend upon Abbott's ability to successfully complete each project, the rate at which each project advances, and the ultimate timing for completion. Given the potential for significant delays and the high rate of failure inherent in the research and development of new pharmaceutical and medical device products and technologies, it is not possible to accurately estimate the total cost to complete all projects currently in development. However, Abbott plans to continue to manage its portfolio of projects to achieve research and development spend equal to approximately 9.5 percent to 10 percent of sales each year. Abbott does not regularly accumulate or make management decisions based on the total expenses incurred for a particular development phase in a given period.

Additionally, products may be entitled to obtain other forms of legal or regulatory exclusivity upon approval. These forms of regulatory exclusivity have a variety of terms in the United States and are variable in other jurisdictions. In the United States, when the FDA approves a new chemical entity that it has not previously approved alone or in combination with other chemical entities, the product is granted 5 years of regulatory exclusivity. The FDA may grant 3 years of market exclusivity for an NDA, including supplementary applications, if the application contains reports of new clinical investigations that have not previously been relied upon by the FDA. If the FDA grants pediatric exclusivity, the longest existing exclusivity (patent or regulatory) related to the product would be extended by 6 months. If the FDA designates a product as an orphan drug that is either used to treat conditions that afflict a relatively small population or for which there is not a reasonable expectation that the research and development costs will be recovered, the FDA may grant 7 years of exclusivity.

Abbott's research and development efforts may not succeed in developing commercially successful products and technologies, which may cause Abbott's revenue and profitability to decline.
research and development
To remain competitive, Abbott must continue to launch new products and technologies. To accomplish this, Abbott commits substantial efforts, funds, and other resources to research and development. A high rate of failure is inherent in the research and development of new products and technologies. Abbott must make ongoing substantial expenditures without any assurance that its efforts will be commercially successful. Failure can occur at any point in the process, including after significant funds have been invested.

In the vascular business, Abbott will continue to focus on marketing
research and development
 Abbott has acquired and continues to acquire significant intangible assets that Abbott records at fair value. Transactions involving the purchase or sale of intangible assets occur with some frequency between companies in the health care field and valuations are usually based on a discounted cash flow analysis. The discounted cash flow model requires assumptions about the timing and amount of future net cash flows, risk, the cost of capital, terminal values and market participants. Each of these factors can significantly affect the value of the intangible asset. Abbott engages independent valuation experts who review Abbott's critical assumptions and calculations for acquisitions of significant intangibles. Abbott reviews definite-lived intangible assets for impairment each quarter using an undiscounted net cash flows approach. If the undiscounted cash flows of an intangible asset are less than the carrying value of an intangible asset, the intangible asset is written down to its fair value, which is usually the discounted cash flow amount. Where cash flows cannot be identified for an individual asset, the review is applied at the lowest group level for which cash flows are identifiable. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, which relate to in-process research and development acquired in a business combination, are reviewed for impairment annually or when an event that could result in an impairment occurs. At December 31, 2010, goodwill and intangibles amounted to $15.9 billion and $12.2 billion, respectively, and amortization expense for intangible assets amounted to $1.4 billion in 2010. There were no impairments of goodwill in 2010, 2009 or 2008.
research and development
Research and development expense was $3.724 billion in 2010, $2.744 billion in 2009 and $2.689 billion in 2008 and represented increases of 35.7 percent in 2010, 2.0 percent in 2009 and 7.3 percent in 2008. Excluding charges related to the Solvay restructurings announced in September 2010, research and development expenses in 2010 increased 29.4 percent. This increase, exclusive of the effects of the restructuring charges, reflects the acquisitions of Solvay's pharmaceuticals business in February 2010 and Facet Biotech in April 2010. The increase in 2009 reflects the favorable effect of exchange rates which reduced research and development expense in 2009. Excluding the effect of exchange, research and development expenses increased 3.4 percent in 2009. The increases in 2010, 2009 and 2008 also reflect continued pipeline spending, including programs in vascular devices, biologics, neuroscience, oncology and hepatitis C. The majority of research and development expenditures are concentrated on pharmaceutical products.
research and development
product rights, of approximately $700 million, goodwill of approximately $350 million and deferred tax liabilities related primarily to the intangible assets of approximately $260 million. The intangible assets are being amortized over 15 years. Abbott agreed to remit cash to Takeda if certain research and development events were not achieved on the development assets retained by Takeda. These amounts were recorded as a liability at closing in the amount of approximately $1.1 billion. Related deferred tax assets of approximately $410 million were also recorded. Of the $1.1 billion, Abbott made tax-deductible payments of $36 million, $83 million and $200 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008. In 2009 events occurred resulting in the remaining payments not being required and the remaining liability in the amount of $797 million was derecognized and recorded as income in Other (income) expense, net.

In 2010, Abbott management approved a restructuring plan primarily related to the acquisition of Solvay's pharmaceuticals business. This plan streamlines operations, improves efficiencies and reduces costs in certain Solvay sites and functions as well as in certain Abbott and Solvay commercial organizations in various countries. Action plans have been identified and most are expected to be implemented within the next two years. This plan will result in pretax charges of approximately $810 million to $970 million over the life of the plan. These charges include employee-related costs of approximately $650 million, accelerated depreciation and asset write-downs of approximately $105 million, and other related exit costs of up to approximately $215 million, mainly related to discontinuation of certain research and development programs and product transfers. Under this plan, Abbott recorded charges to Cost of products sold, Research and development and Selling, general and administrative of approximately $99 million, $152 million and $272 million, respectively. Additional charges of $12 million were subsequently recorded primarily for accelerated depreciation. The following summarizes the activity for this restructuring:

BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION  The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the parent company and subsidiaries, after elimination of intercompany transactions. The accounts of foreign subsidiaries are consolidated as of November 30, due to the time needed to consolidate these subsidiaries. In December 2009, a foreign subsidiary acquired certain technology that was accounted for as acquired in-process research and development. This transaction was recorded in 2009 due to the significance of the amount. No other events occurred related to these foreign subsidiaries in December 2010, 2009 and 2008 that materially affected the financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

In January 2009, Abbott acquired Ibis Biosciences, Inc. (Ibis) for $175 million, in cash, to expand Abbott's position in molecular diagnostics for infectious disease. Including a $40 million investment in Ibis in 2008, Abbott has acquired 100 percent of the outstanding shares of Ibis. A substantial portion of the fair value of the acquisition has been allocated to goodwill and amortizable intangible assets, and acquired in-process research and development which is accounted for as an indefinite-lived intangible asset until regulatory approval or discontinuation. The investment in Ibis in 2008 resulted in a charge to acquired in-process research and development. In connection with the acquisition, the carrying amount of this investment was revalued to fair value resulting in recording $33 million of income, which is reported as Other (income) expense, net.

 Abbott has acquired and continues to acquire significant intangible assets that Abbott records at fair value. Transactions involving the purchase or sale of intangible assets occur with some frequency between companies in the health care field and valuations are usually based on a discounted cash flow analysis. The discounted cash flow model requires assumptions about the timing and amount of future net cash flows, risk, the cost of capital, terminal values and market participants. Each of these factors can significantly affect the value of the intangible asset. Abbott engages independent valuation experts who review Abbott's critical assumptions and calculations for acquisitions of significant intangibles. Abbott reviews definite-lived intangible assets for impairment each quarter using an undiscounted net cash flows approach. If the undiscounted cash flows of an intangible asset are less than the carrying value of an intangible asset, the intangible asset is written down to its fair value, which is usually the discounted cash flow amount. Where cash flows cannot be identified for an individual asset, the review is applied at the lowest group level for which cash flows are identifiable.

Research and development expense was $2.744 billion in 2009, $2.689 billion in 2008 and $2.506 billion in 2007 and represented increases of 2.0 percent in 2009, 7.3 percent in 2008 and 11.1 percent in 2007. The increase in 2009 reflects the favorable effect of exchange rates which reduced research and development expense in 2009. Excluding the effect of exchange, research and development expenses increased 3.4 percent in 2009. The increase in 2007 was affected by the acquisitions of Guidant's vascular intervention and endovascular solutions businesses in April 2006 and Kos Pharmaceuticals Inc. in the fourth quarter of 2006. These increases, excluding the effects of exchange, also reflect continued pipeline spending, including programs in vascular devices, immunology, neuroscience, oncology, Hepatitis C and pain management. The majority of research and development expenditures are concentrated on pharmaceutical products.

The income tax rates on earnings from continuing operations were 19.2 percent in 2008, 19.3 percent in 2007 and 24.6 percent in 2006. Taxes on earnings from continuing operations in 2006 reflect the effect of the tax rates applied to acquired in-process research and development and the resolution of prior years' income tax audits and the effect of other discrete tax items. For 2006, the tax rates applied to acquired in-process and collaborations research and development increased the effective tax rate by 6.6 percentage points and the effect of the income tax audit resolution and other discrete tax items decreased the effective tax rate by 5.5 percentage points. Abbott expects to apply an annual effective rate of between 17.5 percent and 18.0 percent in 2009.

In December 2006, Abbott acquired Kos Pharmaceuticals Inc. for cash of approximately $3.8 billion, net of cash held by Kos Pharmaceuticals Inc., to expand Abbott's presence in the lipid management market and to provide several on-market and late-stage pipeline products. Kos Pharmaceuticals Inc. was a specialty pharmaceutical company that developed and marketed proprietary medications for the treatment of chronic cardiovascular, metabolic and respiratory diseases. This business was acquired on December 13, 2006 and the financial results of the acquired operations are included in these financial statements beginning on that date. The acquisition was financed primarily with short-term debt. The allocation of the purchase price resulted in a charge of $1.3 billion for acquired in-process research and development, intangible assets of $821 million, goodwill (primarily non-deductible) of $1.6 billion and net liabilities, primarily deferred income taxes recorded at acquisition of $331 million. Acquired intangible assets are being amortized over 4 to 15 years. Non-deductible acquired in-process research and development was charged to income in 2006.

and Abbott paid Boston Scientific $250 million, resulting in the recording of additional goodwill. Government approval in Japan is anticipated in late 2009 or early 2010 which will also result in the recording of additional goodwill. The allocation of the purchase price resulted in a charge of $665 million for acquired in-process research and development, intangible assets of $1.2 billion, goodwill (primarily deductible) of $1.7 billion and tangible net assets of $580 million. Acquired intangible assets are being amortized over 4 to 15 years. Deductible acquired in-process research and development was charged to income in 2006. The net tangible assets acquired consist primarily of property and equipment of approximately $530 million, trade accounts receivable of approximately $250 million and inventories of approximately $120 million, net of assumed liabilities, primarily trade accounts payable, litigation reserves and other liabilities.
research and development
Net cash from operating activities of continuing operations amounted to $7.0 billion, $5.2 billion and $5.3 billion in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Cash from operating activities of continuing operations in 2008 compared to 2007 is higher due to higher operating earnings, decreased prepaid expenses and other assets, and increased trade accounts payable and other liabilities. Cash from operating activities of continuing operations in 2007 and 2006 compared to 2005 is higher due to higher net earnings adjusted for after-tax non-cash charges for acquired in-process research and development in 2006 and share-based compensation and higher contributions to retirement benefit plans in 2005 compared to 2007 and 2006; partially offset by higher income tax payments in 2006, including tax payments related to the 2005 remittances of foreign earnings under the American Jobs Creation Act. Abbott funds its domestic pension plans according to IRS funding limitations. In 2008, 2007 and 2006, $200 million was funded to the main domestic pension. Abbott expects pension funding for its main domestic pension plan of $700 million in 2009 and $200 million annually, thereafter. Abbott expects annual cash flow from operating activities to continue to exceed Abbott's capital expenditures and cash dividends.

Statement No. 141 (revised 2007) will impact Abbott primarily in five areas: acquired in-process research and development will be accounted for as an indefinite lived intangible asset until approval or discontinuation rather than as expense; acquisition costs will be expensed rather than added to the cost of an acquisition; restructuring costs in connection with an acquisition will be expensed rather than added to the cost of an acquisition; the fair value of contingent consideration at the date of an acquisition will be included in the cost of an acquisition; and the fair value of contingent liabilities that are more likely than not of occurrence will be recorded at the date of an acquisition. The effect of these changes will be applicable to acquisitions on or after January 1, 2009. Adoption of Statement No. 160 will not have a material effect on Abbott.

In 2008, 2007 and 2006, Abbott management approved plans to realign its worldwide pharmaceutical and vascular manufacturing operations and selected domestic and international commercial and research and development operations in order to reduce costs. In 2008, 2007 and 2006, Abbott recorded charges of approximately $36 million, $107 million and $210 million, respectively, reflecting the impairment of manufacturing facilities and other assets, employee severance and other related charges. Approximately $94 million and $181 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively, is classified as cost of products sold, $3 million and $29 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively, as research and development and $36 million and $10 million in 2008 and 2007, respectively, as selling, general and administrative. Fair value for the determination of the amount of asset impairments was determined primarily based on a discounted cash flow method. An additional $81 million, $90 million and $70 million were subsequently recorded in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, relating to these restructurings, primarily for accelerated depreciation. In addition, Abbott implemented facilities restructuring plans in 2007 related to the acquired operations of Kos Pharmaceuticals Inc., which resulted in an increase to goodwill of approximately $52 million. Abbott expects to incur up to an additional $21 million in future periods for these restructuring plans, primarily for

Abbott's research and development efforts may not succeed in developing commercially successful products and technologies, which may cause Abbott's revenue and profitability to decline.
research and development
To remain competitive, Abbott must continue to launch new products and technologies. To accomplish this, Abbott commits substantial efforts, funds, and other resources to research and development. A high rate of failure is inherent in the research and development of new products and technologies. Abbott must make ongoing substantial expenditures without any assurance that its efforts will be commercially successful. Failure can occur at any point in the process, including after significant funds have been invested.

 Abbott has acquired and continues to acquire significant intangible assets that Abbott records at fair value. Those assets which do not yet have regulatory approval and for which there are no alternative uses are expensed as acquired in-process research and development, and those that have regulatory approval are capitalized. Transactions involving the purchase or sale of intangible assets occur with some frequency between companies in the health care field and valuations are usually based on a discounted cash flow analysis. The discounted cash flow model requires assumptions about the timing and amount of future net cash inflows, risk, the cost of capital, terminal values and market participants. Each of these factors can significantly affect the value of the intangible asset. Abbott engages independent valuation experts who review Abbott's critical assumptions and calculations for

drug-eluting stent increased research and development expenses by 6.3 percentage points over 2005. The increases in 2007 and 2006 were also affected by the acquisitions of Guidant's vascular intervention and endovascular solutions businesses in April 2006 and Kos Pharmaceuticals Inc. in the fourth quarter of 2006. These increases also reflect increased spending to support pipeline programs, including new indications for

as well as several Phase I and Phase II clinical programs in neuroscience and oncology. The majority of research and development expenditures are concentrated on pharmaceutical products.
research and development
In 2007, 2006 and 2005, Abbott management approved plans to realign its worldwide pharmaceutical and vascular manufacturing operations and selected domestic and international commercial and research and development operations in order to reduce costs. In 2007, 2006 and 2005, Abbott recorded pretax charges against earnings of approximately $107, $210 and $256, respectively, reflecting the impairment of manufacturing facilities and other assets, employee severance and other related charges. Approximately $94, $181 and $174, respectively, is classified as cost of products sold, $3, $29 and $10, respectively, as research and development and $10 in 2007 and $72 in 2005 as selling, general and administrative. Fair value for the determination of the amount of asset impairments was determined primarily based on a discounted cash flow method. An additional $90, $70 and $14 were subsequently recorded in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, relating to these restructurings, primarily for accelerated depreciation. In addition, Abbott implemented facilities restructuring plans in 2007 related to the acquired operations of Kos Pharmaceuticals Inc., which resulted in an increase to goodwill of approximately $52.
research and development
The income tax rates on earnings were 19.3 percent in 2007, 24.6 percent in 2006 and 27.0 percent in 2005. Taxes on earnings in 2006 reflect the effect of the tax rates applied to acquired in-process research and development and the resolution of prior years' income tax audits and the effect of other discrete tax items. For 2006, the tax rates applied to acquired in-process and collaborations research and development increased the effective tax rate by 6.6 percentage points and the effect of the income tax audit resolution and other discrete tax items decreased the effective tax rate by 5.5 percentage points. In 2005, Abbott remitted $4.3 billion of foreign earnings in accordance with the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 and recorded additional tax expense of $245 million, which increased the effective tax rate by approximately 5.3 percentage points. This was partially offset by adjustments of prior years' tax accounts resulting primarily from resolution of prior years' accrual requirements, which decreased the effective tax rate by 2.3 percentage points. Abbott expects to apply an annual effective rate of somewhat above 19 percent in 2008.

In December 2006, Abbott acquired Kos Pharmaceuticals Inc. for cash of approximately $3.8 billion, net of cash held by Kos Pharmaceuticals Inc., to expand Abbott's presence in the lipid management market and to provide several on-market and late-stage pipeline products. Kos Pharmaceuticals Inc. was a specialty pharmaceutical company that developed and marketed proprietary medications for the treatment of chronic cardiovascular, metabolic and respiratory diseases. This business was acquired on December 13, 2006 and the financial results of the acquired operations are included in these financial statements beginning on that date. The acquisition was financed primarily with short-term debt. The allocation of the purchase price resulted in a charge of $1.3 billion for acquired in-process research and development, intangible assets of $821 million, goodwill (primarily non-deductible) of $1.6 billion and net liabilities, primarily deferred income taxes recorded at acquisition of $331 million. Acquired intangible assets are being amortized over 4 to 15 years. Non-deductible acquired in-process research and development was charged to income in 2006.

A substantial amount of the acquired in-process research and development charge relating to the Kos acquisition related primarily to cholesterol treatment drugs. The research efforts ranged from 70 percent to 80 percent complete at the date of acquisition. The valuation method used to fair value the projects was the Multi-period Excess Earnings Method (Income Approach) and the risk-adjusted discount rate used was 16 percent. In developing assumptions for the valuation model, comparable Abbott products or products marketed by competitors were used to estimate pricing, margins and expense levels. As of December 31, 2007, one drug was approved for marketing in the U.S. and the remaining research efforts

drug-eluting stent in the U.S. and in Japan. Government approvals are anticipated in 2008 for the U.S. and in 2009 for Japan. Each $250 million payment will result in the recording of additional goodwill. The allocation of the purchase price resulted in a charge of $665 million for acquired in-process research and development, intangible assets of $1.2 billion, goodwill (primarily deductible) of $1.7 billion and tangible net assets of $580 million. Acquired intangible assets are being amortized over 4 to 15 years. Deductible acquired in-process research and development was charged to income in 2006. The net tangible assets acquired consist primarily of property and equipment of approximately $530 million, trade accounts receivable of approximately $250 million and inventories of approximately $120 million, net of assumed liabilities, primarily trade accounts payable, litigation reserves and other liabilities.
research and development
A substantial amount of the acquired in-process research and development charge relating to the Guidant acquisition related to drug eluting and bioabsorbable stents. The research efforts ranged from 35 percent to 85 percent complete at the date of acquisition. The valuation method used to fair value the projects was the Multi-period Excess Earnings Method (Income Approach) and the risk-adjusted discount rates used ranged from 16 percent to 25 percent. In developing assumptions for the valuation model, comparable Abbott products or products marketed by competitors were used to estimate pricing, margins and expense levels. As of December 31, 2007, the research efforts were primarily on schedule. The estimated projected costs to complete totaled approximately $390 million as of December 31, 2007, with anticipated product launch dates from 2008 through 2013. There have been no significant changes in the development plans for the acquired incomplete projects. Significant net cash inflows will commence within one to two years after product launch.
research and development
Net cash from operating activities amounted to $5.2 billion, $5.3 billion and $5.0 billion in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Cash from operating activities in 2007 and 2006 compared to 2005 is higher due to higher net earnings adjusted for after-tax non-cash charges for acquired in-process research and development in 2006 and share-based compensation and higher contributions to retirement benefit plans in 2005 compared to 2007 and 2006; partially offset by higher income tax payments in 2006, including tax payments related to the 2005 remittances of foreign earnings under the American Jobs Creation Act. Abbott funds its domestic pension plans according to IRS funding limitations. In 2007 and 2006, $200 million was funded to the main domestic pension plan and in 2005, $641 million was funded to the main domestic pension plan. Abbott expects pension funding for its main domestic pension plan of $200 million annually. The increased contribution in 2005 was due, in part, to the investment of cash remitted under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. Abbott expects annual cash flow from operating activities to continue to exceed Abbott's capital expenditures and cash dividends.

Abbott engages independent valuation experts who review Abbotts critical assumptions and calculations for significant acquisitions of intangibles. Abbott reviews intangible assets for impairment each quarter using an undiscounted net cash flows approach. If the undiscounted cash flows of an intangible asset are less than the carrying value of an intangible asset, the intangible asset is written down to its fair value, which is usually the discounted cash flow amount. Where cash flows cannot be identified for an individual asset, the review is applied at the lowest group level for which cash flows are identifiable. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually or

In 2006 and 2005, Abbott management approved plans to realign its worldwide pharmaceutical manufacturing operations and selected domestic and international commercial and research and development operations in order to reduce costs. In 2006 and 2005, Abbott recorded pretax charges against earnings of approximately $210 and $256, respectively, reflecting the impairment of manufacturing facilities and other assets, employee severance and other related charges. Approximately $181 and $174, respectively, is classified as cost of products sold, $29 and $10, respectively, as research and development and $72, in 2005, as selling, general and administrative. An additional $70 and $14 were subsequently recorded in 2006 and 2005, respectively, relating to these restructurings, primarily for accelerated depreciation. As a result of product re-registration timelines required under manufacturing regulations in a number of countries, manufacturing related realignments are expected to continue into 2007.

The effective income tax rates on income from continuing operations were 24.6 percent in 2006, 27.0 percent in 2005 and 23.0 percent in 2004. Taxes on earnings in 2006 reflect the effect of the tax rates applied to acquired in-process and collaborations research and development and the resolution of prior years income tax audits and the effect of discrete tax events. For 2006, the tax rates applied to acquired in-process and collaborations research and development increased the effective tax rate by 6.6 percentage points and the effect of the income tax audit resolution and discrete tax events decreased the effective tax rate by 5.5 percentage points. In 2005, Abbott remitted $4.3 billion of foreign earnings in accordance with the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 and recorded additional tax expense of $245 million, which increased the effective tax rate by approximately 5.3 percentage points. This was partially offset by adjustments of prior years tax accounts resulting primarily from resolution of prior years accrual requirements, which decreased the effective tax rate by 2.3 percentage points. The effective tax rate for 2004 reflects adjustments of prior years tax requirements primarily as a result of resolutions of prior years tax audits and the effect of non-deductible acquired in-process research and development. The effect of these items for 2004 was to decrease the effective tax rate by approximately 1.2 percentage points. Abbott expects to apply an annual effective rate of approximately 22.5 percent in 2007.

In 2004, Abbott acquired TheraSense, Inc., a leader in the development, manufacturing and marketing of blood glucose self-monitoring systems, for approximately $1.2 billion in cash; i-STAT Corporation, a manufacturer of point-of-care diagnostic products for blood analysis, for approximately $394 million in cash; EAS, a nutritional company with a portfolio of nationally recognized brands, for approximately $320 million in cash; and Spine Next, a manufacturer of orthopedic spinal implant devices, for approximately $58 million in cash plus additional milestone payments of up to $23 million upon achievement of future targets. Abbott also acquired certain other product technologies for approximately $352 million. These acquisitions resulted in a charge of $271 million for acquired in-process research and development, intangible assets of approximately $1.3 billion, non-tax deductible goodwill of approximately $923 million and deferred income taxes of approximately $406 million. Acquired intangible assets, primarily trade names, are amortized over 5 to 20 years (average of approximately 14 years).

Net cash from operating activities of continuing operations amounted to $5.3 billion, $5.0 billion and $4.3 billion in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The increase in cash from operating activities in 2006 compared to 2005 is due to higher net earnings adjusted for after-tax non-cash charges for acquired in-process research and development and share-based compensation and higher contributions to retirement benefit plans in 2005 compared to 2006; partially offset by higher income tax payments in 2006, including tax payments related to the 2005 remittances of foreign earnings under the American Jobs Creation Act. In 2006, 2005 and 2004, $200 million, $641 million and $482 million, respectively, was contributed to the main domestic defined benefit plan. Abbott expects pension funding for its main domestic pension plan of $200 million annually. The increased contribution in 2005 was due, in part, to the investment of cash remitted under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004.

Subsequent to Abbott's 2001 acquisition of the Knoll pharmaceutical business, which significantly increased the scale of Abbott's pharmaceutical business, Abbott focused on reorganizing and growing its global pharmaceutical business. Abbott has established a global research and development organization and a global manufacturing and distribution organization to serve its domestic and international commercial pharmaceutical operations. Pharmaceutical research and development is focused on five therapeutic areas  immunology, oncology, neuroscience, diabetes/metabolism, and viral diseases. U.S. commercial pharmaceutical operations are focused mainly on primary care and specialty pharmaceuticals. In 2003, Abbott began the worldwide launch of

In 2005, TAP received an approvable letter from the FDA for febuxostat. Contingent upon FDA approval, TAP plans to launch febuxostat in 2006. Pharmaceutical research and development efforts will continue to be focused in the five therapeutic areas noted above with a significant portion of the development expenditures allocated to new

 Abbott has acquired and continues to acquire significant intangible assets that Abbott records at fair value. Those assets which do not yet have regulatory approval and for which there are no alternative uses are expensed as acquired in-process research and development, and those that have regulatory approval are capitalized. Transactions involving the purchase or sale of intangible assets occur with some frequency between companies in the health care field, and valuations are usually based on a discounted cash flow analysis using market participant assumptions. Abbott uses a discounted cash flow model to value most of its acquired intangible assets. The discounted cash flow model requires assumptions about the timing and amount of future net cash inflows, risk, the cost of capital, and terminal values. Each of these factors can significantly affect the value of the intangible asset. Abbott engages independent valuation experts who review Abbott's critical assumptions and calculations for significant acquisitions of intangibles. Abbott reviews intangible assets for impairment each quarter using an undiscounted net cash flows approach. If the undiscounted cash flows of an intangible asset are less than the carrying value of an intangible asset, the intangible asset is written down to its fair value, which is usually the discounted cash flow amount. Where cash flows cannot be identified for an individual asset, the review is applied at the lowest group level for which cash flows are identifiable. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually or when an event that could result in an impairment of goodwill occurs. At December 31, 2005 goodwill and intangibles amounted to $5.2 billion and $4.7 billion, respectively, and amortization expense for intangible assets amounted to approximately $490 million in 2005. There were no impairments of goodwill in 2005, 2004 or 2003.
research and development
Research and development expense, excluding acquired in-process research and development, was $1.8 billion in 2005, $1.7 billion in 2004 and $1.6 billion in 2003 and represented increases of 7.3 percent in 2005, 4.5 percent in 2004 and 10.1 percent in 2003. The majority of research and development expenditures are concentrated on pharmaceutical products.

In 2005, Abbott management approved plans to realign its global manufacturing operations and selected domestic and international commercial operations. In 2005, Abbott recorded pretax charges against earnings of approximately $256 reflecting the impairment of manufacturing facilities and other assets, employee severance and other related charges. Approximately $174 is classified as cost of products sold, $10 as research and development and $72 as selling, general and administrative. An additional $14 was subsequently recorded in 2005 relating to these restructurings, primarily for accelerated depreciation. As a result of product re-registration timelines required under manufacturing regulations in a number of countries, manufacturing related realignments are expected to continue into 2007.

The effective income tax rates on income from continuing operations were 27.0 percent in 2005, 23.0 percent in 2004 and 26.1 percent in 2003. In 2005, Abbott remitted $4.3 billion of foreign earnings in accordance with the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 and recorded additional tax expense of $245 million, which increased the effective tax rate by approximately 5.3 percentage points. This was partially offset by adjustments of prior years' tax accounts resulting primarily from resolution of prior years' accrual requirements, which decreased the effective tax rate by 2.3 percentage points. The effective tax rate for 2004 reflects adjustments of prior years' tax requirements primarily as a result of resolutions of prior years' tax audits and the effect of non-deductible acquired in-process research and development. The effect of these items for 2004 was to decrease the effective tax rate by approximately 1.2 percentage points. The effective tax rate for 2003 includes the effect of the charge for the settlement of the Ross enteral nutritional investigation and the charges for acquired in-process research and development. The effect of these charges for 2003 was to increase the effective tax rate by approximately 2.4 percentage points. Abbott expects to apply an annual effective rate of between 23.5 percent and 24.0 percent in 2006.

In 2005, Abbott acquired the remaining interest in a small medical products company that was previously accounted for under the equity method of accounting and a less than 50 percent equity interest in a small medical products company. The aggregate cash purchase price was approximately $25 million. Acquisition accounting resulted in the recording of non-tax deductible goodwill of approximately $69 million, intangible assets of approximately $22 million and a charge of approximately $17 million for acquired in-process research and development. In 2005, Abbott acquired additional rights related to

In 2004, Abbott paid approximately $2.3 billion for strategic business and technology acquisitions, as follows. Abbott acquired TheraSense, Inc., a leader in the development, manufacturing and marketing of blood glucose self-monitoring systems, for approximately $1.2 billion in cash; i-STAT Corporation, a manufacturer of point-of-care diagnostic products for blood analysis, for approximately $394 million in cash; EAS, a nutritional company with a portfolio of nationally recognized brands, for approximately $320 million in cash; and Spine Next, a manufacturer of orthopedic spinal implant devices, for approximately $58 million in cash plus additional milestone payments of up to $23 million upon achievement of future targets. Abbott also acquired certain other product technologies for approximately $352 million. These acquisitions resulted in a charge of $271 million for acquired in-process research and development, intangible assets of approximately $1.3 billion, non-tax deductible goodwill of approximately $923 million and deferred income taxes of approximately $406 million. Acquired intangible assets, primarily trade names, are amortized over 5 to 20 years (average of approximately 14 years).

In 2003, Abbott paid approximately $459 million for strategic business and technology acquisitions, as follows. Abbott acquired ZonePerfect Nutrition Company, a marketer of healthy and nutritious products for active people, for approximately $160 million in cash; Integrated Vascular Systems, Inc., a developer of a novel vessel closure technology, for approximately $65 million in cash; and Spinal Concepts Inc., a marketer of spinal fixation products used in the treatment of spinal disorders, diseases and injuries, for approximately $166 million in cash plus additional milestone payments of up to $40 million if agreed upon targets are met. Abbott also acquired the assets of JOMED N.V.'s coronary and peripheral interventional business for approximately $68 million in cash. These acquisitions resulted in a charge of approximately $100 million for acquired in-process research and development, intangible assets of approximately $222 million and non-tax deductible goodwill of approximately $182 million.

The effect of these substantially nondeductible charges for 2003 was to increase the effective tax rate by approximately 2.3 percentage points. The 2001 tax rate is lower than the 2003 and 2002 tax rates due primarily to the effect of the benefit of tax exemptions in several taxing jurisdictions in relation to Abbott's lower pretax income in 2001 compared to 2003 and 2002. This had the effect of decreasing the effective tax rate by 8.3 percentage points. The 2002 tax rate is lower than the 2001 tax rate, excluding the effects of the acquisitions of the pharmaceutical business of BASF and of Vysis, Inc. in 2001, due in part to the domestic dividend exclusion applicable to the increased earnings of TAP Pharmaceutical Products Inc. Abbott expects to apply an annual effective rate of 24.5 percent in 2004 due, in part, to the comparatively lower benefit from the domestic dividend exclusion compared to Abbott's total pretax income. Acquired in-process research and development relating to pending 2004 business acquisitions, as discussed below, will be tax effected at discrete tax rates.

In 2003, Abbott acquired ZonePerfect Nutritional Company, a marketer of healthy and nutritious products for active people, for approximately $160 million in cash; Integrated Vascular Systems, Inc., a developer of a novel vessel closure technology, for approximately $65 million in cash; and Spinal Concepts Inc., a marketer of spinal fixation products used in the treatment of spinal disorders, diseases and injuries for approximately $166 million, in cash, plus additional milestone payments of up to $40 million if agreed upon targets are met. In 2003, Abbott also acquired the assets of JOMED N.V.'s coronary and peripheral interventional business for approximately $68 million in cash. These acquisitions resulted in a charge of approximately $100 million for acquired in-process research and development, intangible assets of approximately $222 million and non-tax deductible goodwill of approximately $182 million. Acquired intangible assets, primarily product technology, will be amortized over 9 to 25 years (average of approximately 16 years). Had these acquisitions taken place on January 1 of the previous year, consolidated sales and income would not have been significantly different from reported amounts.

In 2002, Abbott acquired the cardiovascular stent business of Biocompatibles International plc and certain cardiovascular stent technology rights from Medtronic, Inc. In addition, Abbott acquired an additional 28.8 percent of the issued common shares of Hokuriku Seiyaku Co., Ltd., resulting in Abbott owning substantially all of the common shares of Hokuriku Seiyaku Co., Ltd. The aggregate cash purchase price ($586 million) of these strategic business and technology acquisitions resulted in a pretax charge for acquired in-process research and development of approximately $108 million, intangible assets of approximately $145 million and non-tax deductible goodwill of approximately $257 million. Acquired intangible assets, primarily product technology, are amortized over 4 to 13 years (average of approximately 8 years). Had these acquisitions taken place on January 1 of the previous year, consolidated sales and income would not have been significantly different from reported amounts.

On March 2, 2001, Abbott acquired, for cash, the pharmaceutical business of BASF, which included the global operations of Knoll Pharmaceuticals, for approximately $7.2 billion. This acquisition was financed primarily with short- and long-term debt and is accounted for under the purchase method of accounting. The acquisition cost has been allocated to intangible assets, $3.5 billion; goodwill, $2.4 billion; acquired in-process research and development, $1.2 billion; and net tangible assets, $0.1 billion, based on an independent appraisal of fair values. Product rights for marketed products are amortized on a straight-line basis over 10 to 16 years (average 13 years), and goodwill was amortized in 2001 on a straight-line basis over 20 years. Acquired in-process research and development was charged to expense in 2001. The net tangible assets acquired consist primarily of property and equipment of approximately $630 million, trade accounts receivable of approximately $402 million, and inventories of approximately $275 million, net of assumed liabilities, primarily trade accounts payable and other liabilities. Prior to the date of acquisition, Abbott began to plan for the integration and restructuring of the business. In 2001 and 2002, Abbott formally approved several restructuring plans and certain costs of implementing formally approved plans have been included as goodwill. Had this acquisition taken place on January 1, 2000, pro forma consolidated sales for 2001 would have been $16.7 billion, pro forma net income would have been $2.3 billion and pro forma diluted earnings per share would have been $1.46.
research and development
In 2001, Abbott acquired, for cash, all of the outstanding common stock of Vysis, Inc., a leading genomic disease management company. Of the cash acquisition cost of approximately $362 million, $162 million was allocated to developed technology, which is amortized over 15 years, and $143 million was charged against earnings in 2001 for acquired in-process research and development. The remaining acquisition cost was allocated to net tangible assets and goodwill. Had this acquisition taken place on January 1 of the previous year, consolidated sales and income would not have been significantly different from reported amounts.

In January 2004, Abbott announced that it has entered into an agreement to acquire all of the capital stock of TheraSense, Inc., a leader in the development, manufacturing and marketing of blood glucose self-monitoring systems, for $1.2 billion in cash. The completion of the acquisition is subject to approval by the holders of a majority of TheraSense common stock, regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions and is expected to close in the second quarter of 2004. In addition, in January 2004, Abbott acquired, for approximately $392 million in cash, the shares of i-STAT Corporation, a leading manufacturer of point-of-care diagnostic systems for blood analysis, which Abbott did not already own. In 2004, Abbott expects to record a charge of approximately $171 million for acquired in-process research and development, the amount of which is subject to the final appraisal, and approximately $115 million for restructuring and integration costs in connection with these acquisitions.
research and development
Capital expenditures of $1.2 billion in 2003, $1.3 billion in 2002, and $1.2 billion in 2001 were principally for upgrading and expanding manufacturing, research and development, investments in information technology and administrative support facilities in all segments, and for laboratory instruments and hospital equipment placed with customers. This level of capital expenditures is expected to be lower in 2004 following the spin-off of Hospira. An increased proportion of the capital expenditures will be dedicated to the International and Pharmaceutical Products segments.

In 2002, as discussed in Note 10, Abbott announced restructuring plans to align Abbott's global manufacturing operations with its scientific focus and to achieve greater operating efficiencies in its Diagnostic Products and International segments. In 2002, Abbott recorded a pretax charge against earnings of $174, reflecting the impairment of manufacturing facilities and other assets, and employee severance charges. Approximately $83 is classified as Cost of products sold, $5 as Research and development, and $86 as Selling, general and administrative. The restructuring plans resulted in the elimination of approximately 2,100 net positions. Employee groups covered under the restructuring plans included manufacturing, research and development, and sales and administrative-related functions. The accrued restructuring reserve balance at December 31, 2003 of approximately $23 relates primarily to employee severance obligations, which, by local laws must be paid over time.

 Abbott has acquired and continues to acquire significant intangible assets that Abbott values and records. Those assets which do not yet have regulatory approval and for which there are no alternative uses are expensed as acquired in-process research and development, and those that have regulatory approval are capitalized. Generally, transactions involving the purchase or sale of intangible assets occur with some frequency between companies in the health care field, and valuations are usually based on a discounted cash flow analysis. Abbott uses a discounted cash flow model to value intangible assets acquired and for the assessment of impairment. The discounted cash flow model requires assumptions about the timing and amount of future cash inflows and outflows, risk, the cost of capital, and terminal values. Each of these factors can significantly affect the value of the intangible asset. Abbott engages independent valuation experts who review Abbott's critical assumptions for significant acquisitions of intangibles. Abbott reviews intangible assets for impairment each quarter using an undiscounted net cash flows approach. If the undiscounted cash flows of an intangible asset are less than the carrying value of an intangible asset, the intangible asset is written down to the discounted cash flow value. Where cash flows cannot be identified for an individual asset, the review is applied at the lowest group level for which cash flows are identifiable. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually or when an event that could result in an impairment to goodwill occurs.

Research and development expense was $1.6 billion in 2002 and 2001, and $1.4 billion in 2000, and represented 8.8 percent of net sales in 2002, compared to 9.7 percent of net sales in 2001, and 9.8 percent of net sales in 2000. The decline in research and development as a percentage of sales in 2002 was due, in part, to the decline in spending on Phase III clinical trials in 2002. Research and development expenditures continue to be concentrated on pharmaceutical and diagnostic products.

Acquisition costs will generally be expensed as incurred; non-controlling interests will be valued at fair value at the acquisition date; in-process research and development will be recorded at fair value as an indefinite-lived intangible asset at the acquisition date; restructuring costs associated with a business combination will generally be expensed subsequent to the acquisition date; and changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and income tax uncertainties after the acquisition date generally will affect income tax expense. SFAS 141(R) will be effective on a prospective basis for all business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual period subsequent to December 15, 2008, with the exception of the accounting for valuation allowances on deferred taxes and acquired tax contingencies. SFAS 141(R) amends SFAS 109 such that adjustments made to valuation allowances on deferred taxes and acquired tax contingencies associated with acquisitions that closed prior to the effective date of SFAS 141(R) would also apply the provisions of SFAS 141(R).

Our peer group was reviewed with FW Cook in fiscal 2017 and at that time, it was decided to change our peer group to a new peer group consisting of 15 companies selected by us to reflect our current business strategy of focusing more on the end market pharmaceutical space. These companies included in the peer group reflect Aceto’s business strategy, placing greater emphasis on companies whose primary business is tied to health care. The selection criteria to evaluate the peer group companies included comparable business content/model, company size, business characteristics and executive talent. During the fiscal year, we reviewed our peer group with FW Cook and determined that Albany Molecular Research and Sagent Pharmaceuticals, which were in the peer group in 2017, were acquired and were replaced by AMAG Pharmaceuticals Inc. and Luminex Corp. During the 2018 fiscal year, the peer group companies included: Akorn Inc., AMAG Pharmaceuticals Inc., American Vanguard Corporation, Amphastar Pharmaceuticals, ANI Pharmaceuticals, Cambrex Corporation, Depomed, Impax Laboratories, Inc., Innophos Holdings, Inc., Lannett Company, Inc., Lawson Products, Inc., Luminex Corp., Prestige Brand Holdings, Inc., Quaker Chemical Corporation and Usana Health Sciences, Inc. AMAG Pharmaceuticals Inc. was added because it increased the weighting of pharmaceutical companies in the peer group and has similar revenue and market cap to Aceto. Luminex Corp. was added to the peer group during the 2018 fiscal year due to its strong focus on research and development. During the 2018 fiscal year, our compensation consultant conducted a benchmarking review consisting of a competitive review of executive compensation levels for certain executive officers, including our named executive officers. The analysis focused on target compensation in order to provide market competitive comparisons for setting executive compensation opportunities. The Compensation Committee’s benchmarking criteria for these purposes included comparisons of executive base salary compensation, performance awards, long term incentive compensation, total cash compensation (base salary plus annual performance awards), and total direct compensation (total cash compensation plus long-term incentive compensation) of our peer group. Based upon the results of the study, it was determined that Aceto’s executive officers cash compensation generally approximates median levels and most executive officers target bonus was at or above the median. For long-term incentives, the Company’s executive officers were positioned slightly below the market median. Aceto’s target total direct compensation was positioned approximately 11% above the market overall median. The overall positioning at median is aligned with Aceto’s strategy for fiscal 2018 of aggregate positioning at the market median and increased emphasis on long-term incentives as compared to cash compensation.

The primary reasons for the increase in SG&A are $3,244 additional accrued contingent consideration related to the Rising acquisition as well as increased research and development expenses related to certain Rising products and increased information technology maintenance and software related costs. We also experienced additional accrued performance award expense and increased fringe benefits and stock-based compensation expense due to increased financial performance. During fiscal 2012, the Company recorded approximately $884 of one-time costs associated with the separation of certain executive management employees, as well as $761 additional accrued contingent consideration related to the Rising acquisition.

Our products are regulated by the FCC in the U.S. and similar agencies in other countries where we offer our products. Consequently, we and our customers could be positively or negatively affected by the rules and regulations adopted from time to time by the FCC or regulatory agencies in other countries. For example, our wireless communications products, including two-way LMRs, are subject to FCC regulations related to radio frequency spectrum. As a result of limited spectrum availability, the FCC has mandated that new LMR equipment utilize technology that is more spectrum-efficient, which effectively meant that the industry had to migrate to digital technology. These types of mandates may provide us with new business opportunities or may require us to modify all or some of our products so that they can continue to be manufactured and marketed, which may lead to an increase in our capital expenditures and research and development expenses.

The NOLs total $7,507 for federal and $15,107 for state purposes, with expirations starting in 2018 and ending in 2030. Included in the Company’s NOLs as of December 31, 2013 is approximately $1,009 from the exercise of stock options. The benefit from utilization of this portion of the NOL, which equates to a deferred tax asset of approximately $380 and is reserved through a valuation allowance at December 31, 2013, will be recorded as a debit to valuation allowance and credit to additional paid in capital when the related deferred tax asset is realized.

During 2011 and 2010 the Company utilized $4,160 and generated $106, respectively, of its NOLs. The NOL utilization assumes an election under §59(e) to capitalize and amortize certain tax preferences – specifically §174(a) research and development expenditures. The deferred tax asset amounts are based upon management’s conclusions regarding, among other considerations, the Company’s current and anticipated customer base, contracts, and product introductions, certain tax planning strategies, and management’s estimates of future earnings based on information currently available, as well as recent operating results during 2011, 2010, and 2009. ASC Topic 740 “Income Taxes” requires that all positive and negative evidence be analyzed to determine if, based on the weight of available evidence, the Company is more likely than not to realize the benefit of the deferred tax asset.

For 2002, 2001, and 2000, RELM's research, development and engineering expenditures were approximately $1.9 million, $1.4 million, and $1.2 million, respectively. The use of strategic technology partners has enabled us to contain and, in some instances, even reduce R&D expenditures while concentrating on key initiatives, such as the APCO Project 25 digital program. In this connection, costs incurred to date aggregated approximately $0.6 million and we estimate additional costs of $ 1.2 million over the remaining life of the project. Products from these research, development and engineering projects will be completed and introduced at various times through 2005.

Engineering, Research and Development Our product design and development activities are principally conducted in West Melbourne, Florida, where core research and development activities, including product conceptualization, technical writing, printed circuit board layouts, software development and mechanical engineering are conducted. Our engineers and other research and development employees also develop design specifications based on customer requirements and supervise quality assurance activities. Our research and development team actively assists in the implementation of product designs, with primary responsibility for applied engineering, production engineering and the supervision of contract manufacturers. Other activities include ongoing engineering and quality assurance. As of December 31, 2001, we employed 10 people who devote all or a substantial portion of their time to research, development and engineering.

r&d
Engineering and R&D spending in 2001 increased from the previous year by approximately $184,000 (15.7%) due primarily to the development of multi-site dispatch capabilities for our Uniden ESAS system products. We are also executing a comprehensive plan to develop, manufacture, and market digital products that are compliant with the specifications of APCO Project 25.

In 1997, the Company recorded a $1,872 charge related to restructuring. The restructuring consisted of consolidating operations and reducing operating expenses. In consolidating operations, the Company accrued $446 related to the closing of a research and development facility in Indiana and $1,426 relating to the termination of both factory and support employees in Indiana and Florida. In 1998, the Company reduced the liability by $1,694 for lease and severance payments. The remaining liability of $178 in 1998 related to the remaining lease payments of the Indiana facility. During the 1999 the Company completed its transactions related to the restructuring and reduced the liability to zero.

We also utilize third party alliances as a supplement to internal research and development. For example, we are currently utilizing VDV Media, Inc. to develop multi-site dispatch capabilities for our Uniden Esas system products. Expenses for maintenance-of-line engineering as well as research and development totaled $1.2 million, $1.5 million, and $2.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999, and 1998, respectively. We anticipate that we will execute our plan for the development of APCO Project 25 compliant products in 2001, if we are able to raise the necessary funds to execute our plan.
r&d
Engineering and R&D spending in 2000 was reduced from the previous year by approximately $200,000 (13.5%) as our most significant new product initiative, the GMH series radios, was completed. We have developed a comprehensive plan to engineer and manufacture digital products that are compliant with the specifications of APCO Project 25, and we have engaged Janney Montgomery Securities, an investment banker, to assist in obtaining the capital that is required to execute this plan.

Selling, general, and administrative expenses (SG&A) include commissions, marketing, sales, sustaining engineering, product development, management information, accounting, and headquarters. For the year ended December 31, 1999, SG&A expenses totaled $7.5 million or 33.5% of net sales compared with $9.9 million or 33.4% for the prior year. As a result of our restructuring and the sale or discontinuation of certain businesses and product lines, 16 employees and approximately $1.2 million in expenses were eliminated from the SG&A cost structure. R&D spending was reduced $794,000 compared to the prior year as our major R&D project was largely completed. Legal expenses increased during the year as a result of defending litigation that was brought against RELM.

The LMR industry is experiencing a transition from analog products to digital products. In addition, new standards for LMR compatibility (the APCO 25 Standards) have been adopted and the market demand for APCO 25 compliant products is growing. Our future success and prospects for growth will depend upon our ability to enhance current products and to introduce new products which address these and other technological and market developments and satisfy the increasingly sophisticated needs of customers, all in a timely manner. Digital and APCO 25 compliant products are already being brought to the market by several of our competitors. We have not yet offered a digital product or products which are compatible with the APCO 25 standards. Bringing such products to market and achieving a significant share of the market for these products will require substantial expenditures of funds to complete research and development and extensive marketing to achieve market penetration. In order to bring the APCO 25 compliant products to market, we will need additional financing. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in developing and marketing, on a timely basis, fully functional digital products or new products that respond to other technological advances by competitors, or that our new products will be accepted by customers. An inability to successfully compete could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Depreciation, depletion and amortization of the cost of proved oil and gas properties is calculated using the unit-of-production method. The reserve base or denominator used to calculate depreciation, depletion and amortization for leasehold acquisition costs and the cost to acquire proved properties is the sum of proved developed reserves and proved undeveloped reserves. For lease and well equipment, development costs and successful exploration drilling costs, the reserve base includes only proved developed reserves. The numerator for such calculation is actual production volumes for the period. All other property and equipment is depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated average useful lives of three to twenty years.

Future success depends in part on the Company’s ability to find, develop and acquire additional oil and natural gas reserves. Absent ongoing successful acquisition or exploration activities, reserves and revenues will decline as a result of current reserves being depleted by production. The successful acquisition, development or exploration of oil and natural gas properties is dependent upon an assessment of recoverable reserves, future oil and natural gas prices and operating costs, potential environmental and other liabilities, and other factors. These factors are necessarily inexact. As a result, the Company may not recover the purchase price and/or the development costs of a property from the sale of production from the property, or may not recognize an acceptable return from properties acquired. In addition, exploration and development operations may not result in any increases in reserves. Exploration or development may be delayed or cancelled as a result of inadequate capital, compliance with governmental regulations, price controls or mechanical difficulties. In the future, the cost to find or acquire additional reserves may become prohibitive.

18 banking personnel. Communications costs increased primarily due to higher volume-driven costs of Advest's third party data processor and higher telephone equipment and line charges. Occupancy and equipment costs increased due to higher rent expense, personal computers lease expense and service agreements. Professional fees increased primarily due to higher legal and consulting expenses at Advest. Business development costs increased primarily due to more financial advisors qualifying for company-sponsored education and development programs and an increase in the number of educational programs offered.

The statements in this report include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and beliefs and involve numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date hereof or as of the dates indicated in the statements and should not be relied upon as predictions of future events, as we cannot assure you that the events or circumstances reflected in these statements will be achieved or will occur. You can identify forward-looking statements by the use of forward-looking terminology including “believes,” “expects,” “may,” “will,” “should,” “seeks,” “intends,” “plans,” “pro forma,” “estimates,” “anticipates,” or the negative of these words and phrases, other variations of these words and phrases or comparable terminology. The forward-looking statements relate to, among other things: possible impact of future accounting rules on AMD’s consolidated financial statements; demand for AMD’s products; the growth, change and competitive landscape of the markets in which AMD participates; the nature and extent of AMD’s future payments to GLOBALFOUNDRIES Inc. (GF) and the materiality of these payments; the materiality of AMD’s future purchases from GF; AMD’s ability to meet its wafer purchase target; the expected amounts to be received by AMD under the IP licensing agreement and AMD’s expected royalty payments from future product sales of China JVs’ products to be developed on the basis of such licensed IP; sales patterns of AMD’s PC products and semi-custom System-on-Chip (SoC) products for game consoles; the level of international sales as compared to total sales; international sales will continue to be a significant portion of total sales in the foreseeable future; that other unrecognized tax benefits will not materially change in the next 12 months; that AMD’s cash and cash equivalents balances together with the availability under that certain secured revolving line of credit (Secured Revolving Line of Credit) made available to AMD and certain of its subsidiaries under the Amended and Restated Loan Agreement, will be sufficient to fund AMD’s operations including capital expenditures over the next 12 months; AMD’s ability to obtain sufficient external financing on favorable terms, or at all; AMD’s expectation that based on the information presently known to management, the potential liability related to AMD’s current litigation will not have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, cash flows or results of operations; any amounts in addition to what has been already accrued by AMD for future remediation costs under clean-up orders will not be material; we expect to file future patent applications in both the United States and abroad on significant inventions, as we deem appropriate; anticipated increase in costs related to enhancing, implementing and monitoring information security controls, remediating any data security breaches and addressing related litigation, mitigating reputational harm and compliance with external regulations related to our IT assets; we expect to receive $448.5 million upon the exercise of a warrant by West Coast Hitech L.P. (WCH) and issue 75 million shares of our common stock to WCH; revenue allocated to remaining performance obligations that are unsatisfied which will be recognized over the next 12 months; and a small number of customers will continue to account for a substantial part of AMD’s revenue in the future. Material factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from current expectations include, without limitation, the following: Intel Corporation’s dominance of the microprocessor market and its aggressive business practices may limit AMD’s ability to compete effectively; AMD has a wafer supply agreement with GF with obligations to purchase all of its microprocessor and APU product requirements, and a certain portion of its GPU product requirements, manufactured at process nodes larger than 7 nanometer (nm) from GF with limited exceptions. If GF is not able to satisfy AMD’s manufacturing requirements, AMD’s business could be adversely impacted; AMD relies on third parties to manufacture its products, and if they are unable to do so on a timely basis in sufficient quantities and using competitive technologies, AMD’s business could be materially adversely affected; failure to achieve expected manufacturing yields for AMD’s products could negatively impact its financial results; the success of AMD’s business is dependent upon its ability to introduce products on a timely basis with features and performance levels that provide value to its customers while supporting and coinciding with significant industry transitions; if AMD cannot generate sufficient revenue and operating cash flow or obtain external financing, it may face a cash shortfall and be unable to make all of its planned investments in research and development or other strategic investments; the loss of a significant customer may have a material adverse effect on AMD; AMD’s receipt of revenue from its semi-custom SoC products is dependent upon its technology being designed into third-party products and the success of those products; global economic and market uncertainty may adversely impact AMD’s business and operating results; AMD’s products may be subject to security vulnerabilities that could have a material adverse effect on AMD; IT outages, data loss, data breaches and cyber-attacks could compromise AMD’s intellectual property or other sensitive information, be costly to remediate and cause significant damage to its business, reputation and operations; AMD’s operating results are subject to quarterly and seasonal sales patterns; AMD may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service its debt obligations or meet its working capital requirements; AMD has a large amount of indebtedness which could adversely affect its financial position and prevent it from implementing its strategy or fulfilling its contractual obligations; the agreements governing AMD’s notes and the Secured Revolving Line of Credit impose restrictions on AMD that may adversely affect AMD’s ability

Our principal competitor in the discrete graphics market is Nvidia and they are considered the market share leader. Other competitors include a number of smaller companies, which may have greater flexibility to address specific market needs, but less financial resources to do so, especially as we believe that the growing complexity of graphics processors and the associated research and development costs represent an increasingly higher barrier to entry in this market.

We focus our research and development activities on improving product performance and enhancing product design. Our main area of focus is on delivering the next generation of CPU and GPU IP, and designing that IP into our SoCs for our next generation of products, with, in each case, improved system performance and performance-per-watt characteristics. For example, we are focusing on improving the battery life of our APU products for notebooks and the performance and power efficiency of our discrete GPUs and our microprocessors for servers. We are also focusing on delivering a range of low-power integrated platforms to serve key markets, including commercial clients, mobile computing and gaming. We believe that these platforms will bring customers increased performance and energy efficiency. We also work with industry leaders on process technology, software and other functional intellectual property and with others in the industry and industry consortia to conduct early stage research and development. We conduct product and system research and development activities for our products in the United States with additional design and development engineering teams located in Australia, China, Canada, India, Singapore and Taiwan, who undertake specific activities at the direction of our U.S. headquarters.

Intel has substantially greater financial resources than we do and accordingly spends substantially greater amounts on marketing and research and development than we do. We expect Intel to maintain its market position and to continue to invest heavily in marketing, research and development, new manufacturing facilities and other technology companies. To the extent Intel manufactures a significantly larger portion of its microprocessor products using more advanced process technologies, or introduces competitive new products into the market before we do, we may be more vulnerable to Intel’s aggressive marketing and pricing strategies for microprocessor products.
research and development
Our success depends to a significant extent on the development, qualification, implementation and acceptance of new product designs and improvements that provide value to our customers. Our ability to develop, qualify and distribute, and have manufactured, new products and related technologies to meet evolving industry requirements, at prices acceptable to our customers and on a timely basis are significant factors in determining our competitiveness in our target markets. As consumers have new product feature preferences or have different requirements than those consumers in the PC market, PC sales could be negatively impacted, which could adversely impact our business. Our product roadmap includes our next generation AMD Ryzen, AMD Radeon and AMD EPYC processors using 7 nm process technology. We cannot assure you that our efforts to execute our product roadmap will result in innovative products and technologies that provide value to our customers. If we fail to or are delayed in developing, qualifying or shipping new products or technologies that provide value to our customers and address these new trends or if we fail to predict which new form factors consumers will adopt and adjust our business accordingly, we may lose competitive positioning, which could cause us to lose market share and require us to discount the selling prices of our products. Although we make substantial investments in research and development, we cannot be certain that we will be able to develop, obtain or successfully implement new products and technologies on a timely basis or that they will be well-received by our customers. Moreover, our investments in new products and technologies involve certain risks and uncertainties and could disrupt our ongoing business. New investments may not generate sufficient revenue, may incur unanticipated liabilities and may divert our limited resources and distract management from our current operations. We cannot be certain that our ongoing investments in new products and technologies will be successful, will meet our expectations and will not adversely affect our reputation, financial condition and operating results.

If we cannot generate sufficient revenue and operating cash flow or obtain external financing, we may face a cash shortfall and be unable to make all of our planned investments in research and development or other strategic investments.
research and development
Our ability to fund research and development expenditures depends on generating sufficient revenue and cash flow from operations and the availability of external financing, if necessary. Our research and development expenditures, together with ongoing operating expenses, will be a substantial drain on our cash flow and may decrease our cash balances. If new competitors, technological advances by existing competitors, or other competitive factors require us to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated in our research and development efforts, our operating expenses would increase. If we are required to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated in research and development efforts without an increase in revenue, our operating results could decline.

limit our credit lines. Our inability to obtain needed financing or to generate sufficient cash from operations may require us to abandon projects or curtail planned investments in research and development or other strategic initiatives. If we curtail planned investments in research and development or abandon projects, our products may fail to remain competitive and our business would be materially adversely affected.
research and development
In addition, we are entering markets with current and new competitors who may be able to adapt more quickly to customer requirements and emerging technologies. We cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against current or new competitors who may have stronger positions in these new markets or superior ability to anticipate customer requirements and emerging industry trends. We may face delays or disruptions in research and development efforts, or we may be required to invest significantly greater resources in research and development than anticipated.

As of December 29, 2018, we leased approximately 2.47 million square feet of space for research and development, engineering, administrative and warehouse use, including our headquarters in Santa Clara, California, our principal administrative facilities in Austin, Texas, our main facility with respect to graphics and chipset products located in Markham, Ontario, Canada and a number of smaller regional sales offices located in commercial centers near customers, principally in the United States, Latin America, Europe and Asia. These leases expire at varying dates through 2028, although some of these leases include optional renewals. We occupy 220,000 square feet of space in our headquarters in Santa Clara, California under a 10-year operating lease which commenced in August 2017. We have the option to extend the term of the lease for two additional 5-year periods. The lease for our principal administrative facilities in Austin, Texas expires in March 2025, and provides for one 10-year optional renewal. The leases for our facilities in Markham, Ontario, Canada expire in February 2028, and provide for one 5-year optional renewals.

The most significant impacts of the adoption of ASC 606 to the Company related to: (1) the acceleration of revenue recognition for sales of semi-custom products subject to a non-cancellable customer purchase order, (2) the acceleration of revenue recognition for sales to distributors, and (3) the timing and financial statement classification of certain development and intellectual property licensing agreements. Revenue from sales of semi-custom products under non-cancellable purchases orders, and that have no alternative use to the Company at contract inception, is recognized, based on the value of the semi-custom products and expected margin, over the time of production of the semi-custom products by the Company, rather than upon shipment. Revenue from sales to the Company's distributors is recognized upon shipment of the product to the distributors (sell-in), net of provision for estimated reserves, instead of the previous revenue recognition which was upon the reported resale of the product by the distributors to their customers (sell-through). For a development and IP licensing agreement executed in 2017, the Company recognized IP-related revenue in the third quarter of 2018 for the entire amount of arrangement consideration upon the completion of all the technology milestones. Previously, the agreement resulted in the reduction to research and development expenses in 2017 for development work as the expenses were incurred and would have resulted in licensing revenue to be recognized in periods beyond 2017 upon completion of the deliverables, based on a fair value allocation of the consideration received. Revenue recognition related to the Company’s other revenue streams remain substantially unchanged.
research and development
2017 Research and development expenses increased due to the absence of credits to research and development expenses recognized for a development and intellectual property licensing agreement under the “As reported” standard, the entire amount of consideration was recognized as revenue in 2018 upon transfer of control of the IP license to the customer under the new standard.

2017 Other current liabilities adjusted primarily due to the absence of credits to research and development expenses recognized for a development and intellectual property licensing agreement under the “As reported” standard, the entire amount of consideration was recognized as revenue in 2018 upon transfer of control of the IP license to the customer under the new standard. The credits are recorded as deferred revenue under the new standard.

2017 Computing and Graphics operating income decreased primarily due to the lower revenue from sales to distributors. In addition, 2017 is lower due to the absence of credits to research and development expenses recognized for a development and intellectual property licensing agreement under the “As Reported” standard, the entire amount of consideration was recognized as revenue in 2018 upon transfer of control of the IP license to the customer under the new standard. 2016 Computing and Graphics operating loss increased due to slightly higher operating expenses.

2017 Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom operating income decreased primarily due to lower revenue from sales of semi-custom products. In addition, 2017 is lower due to the absence of credits to research and development expenses recognized for a certain development and intellectual property licensing agreement under the “As reported” standard, the entire amount of consideration was recognized as revenue in 2018 upon transfer of control of the IP license to the customer under the new standard. 2016 Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom operating income increased due to higher revenue from sales of semi-custom products.

(WCH) of warrants to purchase 75 million shares of its common stock, if and when exercised, will dilute the ownership interests of AMD's existing stockholders, and the conversion of the 2.125% Convertible Senior Notes due 2026 (2.125% Notes) may dilute the ownership interest of AMD's existing stockholders, or may otherwise depress the price of its common stock; uncertainties involving the ordering and shipment of AMD’s products could materially adversely affect it; the demand for AMD’s products depends in part on the market conditions in the industries into which they are sold. Fluctuations in demand for AMD’s products or a market decline in any of these industries could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations; AMD’s ability to design and introduce new products in a timely manner is dependent upon third-party intellectual property; AMD depends on third-party companies for the design, manufacture and supply of motherboards, software and other computer platform components to support its business; if AMD loses Microsoft Corporation’s support for its products or other software vendors do not design and develop software to run on AMD’s products, its ability to sell

Intel has substantially greater financial resources than we do and accordingly spends substantially greater amounts on marketing and research and development than we do. We expect Intel to maintain its market position and to continue to invest heavily in marketing, research and development, new manufacturing facilities and other technology companies. To the extent Intel manufactures a significantly larger portion of its microprocessor products using more advanced process technologies, or introduces competitive new products into the market before we do, we may be more vulnerable to Intel’s aggressive marketing and pricing strategies for microprocessor products.

We focus our research and development activities on improving product performance and enhancing product design. Our main area of focus is on delivering the next generation of CPU and GPU IP, and designing that IP into our SoCs for our next generation of products, with, in each case, improved system performance and performance-per-watt characteristics. For example, we are focusing on improving the battery life of our APU products for notebooks, the power efficiency of our microprocessors for servers and the performance and power efficiency of our discrete GPUs. We are also focusing on delivering a range of low-power integrated platforms to serve key markets, including commercial clients, mobile computing

Our success depends to a significant extent on the development, qualification, implementation and acceptance of new product designs and improvements that provide value to our customers. Our ability to develop, qualify and distribute, and have manufactured, new products and related technologies to meet evolving industry requirements, at prices acceptable to our customers and on a timely basis are significant factors in determining our competitiveness in our target markets. For example, a large portion of our Computing and Graphics revenue is focused on consumer desktop PC and notebook. While overall growth in Computing and Graphics is stabilizing, the areas within Computing and Graphics are changing. Our ability to take advantage of the opportunities within the areas of Computing and Graphics is based on foreseeing those changes and making timely investments in the form factors that serve those areas. As consumers adopt new form factors, have new product feature preferences or have different requirements than those consumers in the PC market, PC sales could be negatively impacted, which could adversely impact our business. Our product roadmap includes AMD Ryzen™ and AMD EPYC™ processors based on our new x86 processor core codenamed “Zen” to help drive our re-entry into high-performance and server computing. We cannot assure you that our efforts to execute our product roadmap and address markets beyond our core PC market will result in innovative products and technologies that provide value to our customers. If we fail to or are delayed in developing, qualifying or shipping new products or technologies that provide value to our customers and address these new trends or if we fail to predict which new form factors consumers will adopt and adjust our business accordingly, we may lose competitive positioning, which could cause us to lose market share and require us to discount the selling prices of our products. Although we make substantial investments in research and development, we cannot be certain that we will be able to develop, obtain or successfully implement new products and technologies on a timely basis or that they will be well-received by our customers. Moreover, our investments in new products and technologies involve certain risks and uncertainties and could disrupt our ongoing business. New investments may not generate sufficient revenue, may incur unanticipated liabilities and may divert our limited resources and distract management from our current operations. We cannot be certain that our ongoing investments in new products and technologies will be successful, will meet our expectations and will not adversely affect our reputation, financial condition and operating results.

If we cannot generate sufficient revenue and operating cash flow or obtain external financing, we may face a cash shortfall and be unable to make all of our planned investments in research and development or other strategic investments.
research and development
Our ability to fund research and development expenditures depends on generating sufficient revenue and cash flow from operations and the availability of external financing, if necessary. Our research and development expenditures, together with ongoing operating expenses, will be a substantial drain on our cash flow and may decrease our cash balances. If new competitors, technological advances by existing competitors or other competitive factors require us to invest significantly greater resources
research and development
than anticipated in our research and development efforts, our operating expenses would increase. If we are required to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated in research and development efforts without an increase in revenue, our operating results could decline.
research and development
We regularly assess markets for external financing opportunities, including debt and equity financing. Additional debt or equity financing may not be available when needed or, if available, may not be available on satisfactory terms. The health of the credit markets may adversely impact our ability to obtain financing when needed. Any downgrades from credit rating agencies such as Moody’s or Standard & Poor’s may adversely impact our ability to obtain external financing or the terms of such financing. Credit agency downgrades or concerns regarding our credit worthiness may impact relationships with our suppliers, who may limit our credit lines. Our inability to obtain needed financing or to generate sufficient cash from operations may require us to abandon projects or curtail planned investments in research and development or other strategic initiatives. If we curtail planned investments in research and development or abandon projects, our products may fail to remain competitive and our business would be materially adversely affected.
research and development
In addition, we are entering markets with current and new competitors who may be able to adapt more quickly to customer requirements and emerging technologies. We cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against current or new competitors who may have stronger positions in these new markets or superior ability to anticipate customer requirements and emerging industry trends. We may face delays or disruptions in research and development efforts, or we may be required to invest significantly greater resources in research and development than anticipated.

Custom products which are associated with the Company’s Enterprise, Embedded, and Semi-Custom segment (semi-custom products), under non-cancellable purchases orders, which are manufactured to customers’ specifications, and cannot be re-sold to another customer, will be recognized as revenue, based on the value of the inventory and expected margin, over the time of production of the products by the Company, rather than upon shipment. Revenue from sales to the Company's distributors will be recognized as revenue upon shipment of the product to the distributors (sell-in), instead of the current revenue recognition upon reported resale of the product by the distributors to their customers (sell-through). For a development and intellectual property licensing agreement executed in 2017, the Company will recognize revenue for the entire consideration upon transfer of control of the intellectual property (IP) license to the customer in a future period. Previously, the agreement resulted in the reduction to research and development expenses in 2017 for development work as the expenses were incurred and would have resulted in licensing revenue to be recognized in periods beyond 2017 upon completion of the deliverables, based on a fair value allocation of the consideration received. Revenue recognition related to the Company’s other revenue streams will remain substantially unchanged.

r&d
Gross margin, as a percentage of net revenue for 2016, was 23% compared to 27% in 2015. The decrease in gross margin in 2016 as compared to 2015 was primarily due to a $340 million charge taken in the third quarter of 2016 (the WSA Charge) related to the sixth amendment to the wafer supply agreement (the Sixth Amendment) with GLOBALFOUNDRIES Inc. (GF). Operating loss for 2016 was $372 million compared to a $481 million for 2015. This improvement in operating performance in 2016 compared to 2015 was due to an increase in net revenue described above, a reduction in restructuring and other special charges, net and a licensing gain related to an intellectual property license agreement in connection with the joint ventures in China that we formed with Tianjin Haiguang Advanced Technology Investment Co. Ltd. (THATIC), partially offset by an increase in cost of sales due to the WSA Charge. During 2016, we continued to closely manage our operating expenses. Our operating expenses in 2016 decreased to $1.5 billion, compared to $1.6 billion in 2015, due to the absence of restructuring charges in 2016, partially offset by increased R&D expenses.

The decrease was partially offset by a $16 million increase in research and development expenses attributable to our Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment. Research and development expenses attributable to our Computing and Graphics segment decreased primarily due to a $116 million decrease in product engineering and design costs and a $4 million decrease in other employee compensation and benefit expenses. Research and development expenses attributable to our Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment increased primarily due to a $17 million increase in product engineering and design costs.

Intel has substantially greater financial resources than we do and accordingly spends substantially greater amounts on marketing and research and development than we do. We expect Intel to maintain its market position and to continue to invest heavily in marketing, research and development, new manufacturing facilities and other technology companies. To the extent Intel manufactures a significantly larger portion of its microprocessor products using more advanced process technologies, or introduces competitive new products into the market before we do, we may be more vulnerable to Intel’s aggressive marketing and pricing strategies for microprocessor products. For example, Intel has introduced microprocessors for low-cost notebooks, similar to products that we offer for low-cost notebooks.

Our principal competitor in the graphics market is Nvidia. AMD and Nvidia are the two principal players offering discrete graphics solutions. Other competitors include a number of smaller companies, which may have greater flexibility to address specific market needs, but less financial resources to do so, especially as we believe that the growing complexity of graphics processors and the associated research and development costs represent an increasingly higher barrier to entry in this market. In the semi-custom game console products, where graphics performance is critical, we compete primarily against Nvidia, and also compete against Imagination Technology Group.

We focus our research and development activities on improving product performance and enhancing product design. Our main area of focus is on delivering the next generation of CPU and GPU IP, and designing that IP into our SoCs for our next generation of products,with, in each case, improved system performance and performance-per-watt characteristics. For example, we are focusing on improving the battery life of our microprocessors and APU products for notebooks and the power efficiency of our microprocessors for servers. We are also focusing on delivering a range of low-power integrated platforms to serve key markets, including commercial clients, mobile computing and gaming and media computing. We believe that these platforms will bring customers increased performance and energy efficiency. We also work with industry leaders on process technology, software and other functional intellectual property and we work with others in the industry and industry consortia to conduct early stage research and development.

Our success depends to a significant extent on the development, qualification, implementation and acceptance of new product designs and improvements that provide value to our customers. Our ability to develop, qualify and distribute, and have manufactured, new products and related technologies to meet evolving industry requirements, at prices acceptable to our customers and on a timely basis are significant factors in determining our competitiveness in our target markets. For example, a large portion of our Computing and Graphics revenue is focused on consumer desktop PC and notebook segments, which have experienced and continue to experience a decline driven by, among other factors, the adoption of smaller form factors, increased competition and changes in replacement cycles. As consumers adopt new form factors, have new product feature preferences or have different requirements than those consumers in the PC market, PC sales could be negatively impacted, which could adversely impact our business. Our product roadmap includes a new x86 processor core codenamed “Zen” to help drive our re-entry into high-performance and server computing. We cannot assure you that our efforts to execute our product roadmap and address markets beyond our core PC market will result in innovative products and technologies that provide value to our customers. If we fail to or are delayed in developing, qualifying or shipping new products or technologies that provide value to our customers and address these new trends or if we fail to predict which new form factors consumers will adopt and adjust our business accordingly, we may lose competitive positioning, which could cause us to lose market share and require us to discount the selling prices of our products. Although we make substantial investments in research and development, we cannot be certain that we will be able to develop, obtain or successfully implement new products and technologies on a timely basis.

If we cannot generate sufficient revenue and operating cash flow or obtain external financing, we may face a cash shortfall and be unable to make all of our planned investments in research and development or other strategic investments.
research and development
Our ability to fund research and development expenditures depends on generating sufficient revenue and cash flow from operations and the availability of external financing, if necessary. Our research and development expenditures, together with ongoing operating expenses, will be a substantial drain on our cash flow and may decrease our cash balances. If new competitors, technological advances by existing competitors or other competitive factors require us to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated in our research and development efforts, our operating expenses would increase. If we are required to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated in research and development efforts without an increase in revenue, our operating results could decline.
research and development
Credit agency downgrades or concerns regarding our credit worthiness may impact relationships with our suppliers, who may limit our credit lines. Our inability to obtain needed financing or to generate sufficient cash from operations may require us to abandon projects or curtail planned investments in research and development or other strategic initiatives. If we curtail planned investments in research and development or abandon projects, our products may fail to remain competitive and our business would be materially adversely affected.

In addition, we are entering markets with current and new competitors who may be able to adapt more quickly to customer requirements and emerging technologies. We cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against current or new competitors who may have stronger positions in these new markets or superior ability to anticipate customer requirements and emerging industry trends. We may face delays or disruptions in research and development efforts, or we may be required to significantly invest greater resources in research and development than anticipated.

Moreover, our business strategy is dependent on creating products that anticipate customer requirements and emerging industry trends. For example, throughout 2014, we sampled Seattle, our first 64-bit ARM server processor and in the second quarter of 2014, we announced a 64-bit ARM architectural license for the development of custom high-performance cores for high-growth adjacent markets. Also in the second quarter of 2014 we announced our third generation mainstream and low powered mobile APUs, formerly codenamed Mullins and Beema, and we released our new embedded APU, formerly codenamed Bald Eagle, which is our first embedded processor to incorporate HSA features. We cannot assure you that our new strategic direction, including our efforts to address markets beyond our core PC market and our efforts to create ARM-based products, will result in innovative products and technologies that provide value to our customers. In addition, we may be entering markets where current and new competitors may be able to adapt more quickly to customer requirements and emerging technologies. We cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against current or new competitors who may have stronger positions in these new markets. We may face delays or disruptions in research and development efforts, or we may be required to significantly invest greater resources in research and development than anticipated.

processor for servers in the first quarter of 2014; that our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and available external financing will be sufficient to fund our operations including capital expenditures over the next twelve months; our dependence on a small number of customers; our hedging strategy; and the timing of the implementation of certain ENERGYSTAR specifications. Material factors and assumptions that were applied in making these forward-looking statements include, without limitation, the following: the expected rate of market growth and demand for our products and technologies (and the mix thereof); GFs manufacturing yields and wafer volumes; our expected market share; our expected product costs and average selling price; our overall competitive position and the competitiveness of our current and future products; our ability to introduce new products, consistent with our current roadmap; our ability to make additional investment in research and development and that such opportunities will be available; the expected demand for computers; and the state of credit markets and macroeconomic conditions. Material factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from current expectations include, without limitation, the following: that Intel Corporations pricing, marketing and rebating programs, product bundling, standard setting, new product introductions or other activities may negatively impact our plans; that we will require additional funding and may be unable to raise sufficient capital on favorable terms, or at all; that customers stop buying our products or materially reduce their operations or demand for our products; that we may be unable to develop, launch and ramp new products and technologies in the volumes that are required by the market at mature yields on a timely basis; that our third-party foundry suppliers will be unable to transition our products to advanced manufacturing process technologies in a timely and effective way or to manufacture our products on a timely basis in sufficient quantities and using competitive process technologies; that we will be unable to obtain sufficient manufacturing capacity or components to meet demand for our products or will not fully utilize our projected manufacturing capacity needs at GFs microprocessor manufacturing facilities; that our requirements for wafers will be less than the fixed number of wafers that we agreed to purchase from GF or GF encounters problems that significantly reduce the number of functional die we receive from each wafer; that we are unable to successfully implement our long-term business strategy; that we inaccurately estimate the quantity or type of products that our customers will want in the future or will ultimately end up purchasing, resulting in excess or obsolete inventory; that we are unable to manage the risks related to the use of our third-party distributors and add-in-board (AIB) partners or offer the appropriate incentives to focus them on the sale of our products; that we may be unable to maintain the level of investment in research and development that is required to remain competitive; that there may be unexpected variations in
research and development
Intel has substantially greater financial resources than we do and accordingly spends substantially greater amounts on marketing and research and development than we do. We expect Intel to maintain its dominant position and to continue to invest heavily in marketing, research and development, new manufacturing facilities and other technology companies. To the extent Intel manufactures a significantly larger portion of its microprocessor products using more advanced process technologies, or introduces competitive new products into the market before we do, we may be more vulnerable to Intels aggressive marketing and pricing strategies for microprocessor products. For example, Intel recently introduced microprocessors for low-cost notebooks, similar to products that we offer for low-cost notebooks.

Other than Intel, our principal competitor in the graphics and visual solutions market is Nvidia. AMD and Nvidia are the two principal players offering discrete graphics solutions. Other competitors include a number of smaller companies, which may have greater flexibility to address specific market needs, but less financial resources to do so, especially as we believe that the growing complexity of visual processors and the associated research and development costs represent an increasingly higher barrier to entry in this market.

We focus our research and development activities on improving and enhancing product design. One main area of focus is on delivering the next generation of products with greater system level integration of the CPU and GPU and transforming our products into SOCs, with, in each case, improved system performance and performance-per-watt characteristics. For example, we are focusing on improving the battery life of our microprocessors and APU products for notebooks and tablets and the power efficiency of our microprocessors for servers. We are also focusing on delivering a range of low-power integrated platforms to serve key markets, including commercial clients, mobile computing and gaming and media computing, as well as developing an HSA, which is designed for software developers to easily program APUs by combining scalar processing on the CPU with parallel processing on the GPU, all while providing high bandwidth access to memory at low power. We believe that these integrated platforms will bring customers better time-to-market and increased performance and energy efficiency. We also work with industry leaders on process technology, software and other functional intellectual property and we work with others in the industry, public foundations, universities and industry consortia to conduct early stage research and development.
research and development
Our research and development expenses for 2013, 2012 and 2011 were approximately $1.2 billion, $1.4 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively. For more information, see Part II, Item 7-Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, or MD&A.
research and development
We conduct product and system research and development activities for our products in the United States with additional design and development engineering teams located in China, Canada, India, Singapore, Taiwan and Israel.

Our success depends to a significant extent on the development, qualification, implementation and acceptance of new product designs and improvements that provide value to our customers. Our ability to develop, qualify and distribute, and have manufactured, new products and related technologies to meet evolving industry requirements, at prices acceptable to our customers and on a timely basis are significant factors in determining our competitiveness in our target markets. For example, form factors have increasingly shifted from desktop PCs and notebooks to tablets, and tablets have been one of the fastest growing form factors. Historically, a significant portion of our Computing Solutions revenue has been related to desktop PCs. Currently, a significant portion of our business is focused on the consumer PC portions of the market, and we believe that PC market conditions will remain challenging. As consumers adopt new form factors and have different requirements than those consumers in the PC market, PC sales could be negatively impacted, which could negatively impact our business. If we fail to or are delayed in developing, qualifying or shipping new products or technologies that provide value to our customers and address these new trends or if we fail to predict which new form factors consumers will adopt, we may lose competitive positioning, which could cause us to lose market share and require us to discount the selling prices of our products. Although we make substantial investments in research and development, we cannot be certain that we will be able to develop, obtain or successfully implement new products and technologies on a timely basis.
research and development
If we cannot generate sufficient revenues and operating cash flow or obtain external financing, we may face a cash shortfall and be unable to make all of our planned investments in research and development or other strategic investments.
research and development
Our ability to fund research and development expenditures depends on generating sufficient cash flow from operations and the availability of external financing, if necessary. Our research and development expenditures, together with ongoing operating expenses, will be a substantial drain on our cash flow and may decrease our cash balances. If new competitors, technological advances by existing competitors or other competitive factors require us to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated in our research and development efforts, our operating expenses would increase. If we are required to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated in research and development efforts without an increase in revenue, our operating results could decline.
research and development
We regularly assess markets for external financing opportunities, including debt and equity financing. Additional debt or equity financing may not be available when needed or, if available, may not be available on satisfactory terms. The health of the credit markets may adversely impact our ability to obtain financing when needed. Any downgrades from credit rating agencies such as Moodys or Standard & Poors may adversely impact our ability to obtain external financing or the terms of such financing. In addition, credit agency downgrades or concerns regarding our credit worthiness may impact relationships with our suppliers, who may limit our credit lines. For example, in the first quarter of 2013, Moodys lowered our senior unsecured debt rating to B2 from B1 and Standard & Poor lowered our senior unsecured debt rating to B from BB. Our inability to obtain needed financing or to generate sufficient cash from operations may require us to abandon projects or curtail planned investments in research and development or other strategic initiatives. If we curtail planned investments in research and development or abandon projects, our products may fail to remain competitive and our business would be materially adversely affected.
research and development
Moreover, our business strategy is dependent on creating products that anticipate customer requirements and emerging industry trends. We cannot assure you that our new strategic direction will result in innovative products and technologies that provide value to our customers. In addition, we may be entering markets where current and new competitors may be able to adapt more quickly to customer requirements and emerging technologies. We cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against current or new competitors who may have stronger positions in these new markets. We may face delays or disruptions in research and development efforts, or we may be required to significantly invest greater resources in research and development than anticipated.

The developed technology of SeaMicro relates to SeaMicros SM10000 server offerings, which is built around a parallel array of independent ultra-low power processors, and it serves to integrate computation, switching, server management and load balancing. In addition to developed technology, SeaMicro had in-process research and development projects, which were incomplete at the time of the acquisition. The value of developed technology and in-process research and development was determined based on the present value of estimated expected cash flows attributable to the technology. The customer relationships related to the ability to sell existing, in-process and future versions of the technology to SeaMicros existing customers and were valued based on incremental cash flows generated from the existing customer base. The trade name related to the SeaMicro brand names. The goodwill was primarily attributed to premiums paid for synergies between the Company and SeaMicro and the assembled workforce and is not deductible for tax purposes. The acquired developed technology, customer relationships and trade name are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. The acquired in-process research and development and goodwill associated with the acquisition are categorized as indefinite-lived intangible assets and subject to impairment review. Capitalized acquired in-process research and development costs will remain capitalized until such time as the projects are complete, at which point they will be amortized, or they will be written off when it is probable the projects will not be completed. As of December 28, 2013, approximately $5 million of in-process research and development projects were completed and classified as developed technology, and the Company started to amortize these projects on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives.

Material factors and assumptions that were applied in making these forward-looking statements include, without limitation, the following: the expected rate of market growth and demand for our products and technologies (and the mix thereof); GFs manufacturing yields and wafer volumes; our expected market share; our expected product costs and average selling price; our overall competitive position and the competitiveness of our current and future products; our ability to introduce new products, consistent with our current roadmap; our ability to make additional investment in research and development and that such opportunities will be available; the expected demand for computers; and the state of credit markets and macroeconomic conditions. Material factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from current expectations include, without limitation, the following: that Intel Corporations pricing, marketing and rebating programs, product bundling, standard setting, new product introductions or other activities may negatively impact our plans; that we will require additional funding and may be unable to raise sufficient capital on favorable terms, or at all; that customers stop buying our products or materially reduce their operations or demand for our products; that we may be unable to develop, launch and ramp new products and technologies in the volumes that are required by the market at mature yields on a timely basis; that our third party foundry suppliers will be unable to transition our products to advanced manufacturing process technologies in a timely and effective way or to manufacture our products on a timely basis in sufficient quantities and using competitive process technologies; that we will be unable to obtain sufficient manufacturing capacity or components to meet demand for our products or will not fully utilize our projected manufacturing capacity needs at GFs microprocessor manufacturing facilities; that our requirements for wafers will be less than the fixed number of wafers that we agreed to purchase from GF or GF encounters problems that significantly reduce the number of functional die we receive from each wafer; that we are unable to successfully implement our long-term business strategy; that we inaccurately estimate the quantity or type of products that our customers will want in the future or will ultimately end up purchasing, resulting in excess or obsolete inventory; that we are unable to manage the risks related to the use of our third-party distributors and add-in-board (AIB) partners or offer the appropriate incentives to focus them on the sale of our products; that we may be unable to maintain the level of investment in research and development that is required to remain competitive; that there may be unexpected variations in market growth and demand for our products and technologies in light of the product mix that we may have available at any particular time; that global business and economic conditions will not improve or will worsen; that PC market conditions do not improve or will worsen; that demand for computers will be lower than currently expected; and the effect of political or economic instability, domestically or internationally, on our sales or supply chain.

Intel has substantially greater financial resources than we do and accordingly spends substantially greater amounts on marketing and research and development than we do. We expect Intel to maintain its dominant position and to continue to invest heavily in marketing, research and development, new manufacturing facilities and other technology companies. To the extent Intel manufactures a significantly larger portion of its microprocessor products using more advanced process technologies, or introduces competitive new products into the market before we do, we may be more vulnerable to Intels aggressive marketing and pricing strategies for microprocessor products.

We focus our research and development activities on improving and enhancing product design. One main area of focus is on delivering the next generation of products with greater system level integration of the CPU and GPU, improved system performance and performance-per-watt characteristics. For example, we are focusing on improving the battery life of our microprocessors and APU products for mobile PCs and the power efficiency of our microprocessors for servers. We are also focusing on delivering a range of low power integrated platforms to serve key markets, including commercial clients, mobile computing, and gaming and media computing, as well as developing a Heterogeneous System Architecture, which is designed for software developers to easily program APUs by combining scalar processing on the CPU with parallel processing on the GPU, all while providing high bandwidth access to memory at low power. We believe that these integrated platforms will bring customers better time-to-market and increased performance and energy efficiency. We also work with industry leaders on process technology, software and other functional intellectual property and we work with others in the industry, public foundations, universities and industry consortia to conduct early stage research and development.
research and development
Our research and development expenses for 2012, 2011 and 2010 were approximately $1.4 billion, $1.5 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively. For more information, see Part II, Item 7-Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, or MD&A.
research and development
We conduct product and system research and development activities for our products in the United States with additional design and development engineering teams located in Canada, India, China, Singapore, Taiwan, United Kingdom, Israel and Japan.

Our success depends to a significant extent on the development, qualification, implementation and acceptance of new product designs and improvements that provide value to our customers. Our ability to develop, qualify and distribute new products and related technologies to meet evolving industry requirements, at prices acceptable to our customers and on a timely basis are significant factors in determining our competitiveness in our target markets. For example, form factors have increasingly shifted from desktop PCs to mobile PCs, and tablets have been one of the fastest growing form factors. Also, ARM-based processors are being used in mobile and embedded electronics products as relatively low cost and small microprocessors and also in form factors such as laptops, tablets and smartphones. Historically, a significant portion of our Computing Solutions revenue has been related to desktop PCs. Currently, approximately 85% of our business is focused on the legacy PC portions of the market, projected to have slowing growth over the next several years. To the extent consumers adopt new form factors and have different requirements than those consumers in the PC market, PC sales could be negatively impacted, which could negatively impact our business. If we fail to or are delayed in developing, qualifying or shipping new products or technologies that provide value to our customers and address these new trends, we may lose competitive positioning, which could cause us to lose market share and require us to discount the selling prices of our products. Although we make substantial investments in research and development, we cannot be certain that we will be able to develop, obtain or successfully implement new products and technologies on a timely basis.
research and development
If we cannot generate sufficient revenues and operating cash flow or obtain external financing, we may face a cash shortfall and be unable to make all of our planned investments in research and development or other strategic investments.
research and development
Our ability to fund research and development expenditures depends on generating sufficient cash flow from operations and the availability of external financing, if necessary. Our research and development expenditures, together with ongoing operating expenses, will be a substantial drain on our cash flow and may decrease our cash balances. If new competitors, technological advances by existing competitors or other competitive factors require us to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated in our research and development efforts, our operating expenses would increase. If we are required to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated in research and development efforts without an increase in revenue, our operating results could decline.
research and development
We believe that the challenging macroeconomic conditions that we experienced in the second half of 2012 will continue during the first half of 2013. We regularly assess markets for external financing opportunities, including debt and equity financing. Additional debt or equity financing may not be available when needed or, if available, may not be available on satisfactory terms. The health of the credit markets may adversely impact our ability to obtain financing when needed. In addition, any downgrades from credit rating agencies such as Moodys or Standard & Poors may adversely impact our ability to obtain external financing or the terms of such financing. Credit agency downgrades may also impact relationships with our suppliers, who may limit our credit lines. For example, in the first quarter of 2013 Moodys lowered our corporate family rating to B2 from B1, and the ratings on our senior unsecured notes to B2 from B1. Furthermore, in the first quarter of 2013, Standard & Poor lowered our corporate credit and senior unsecured rating from B to BB. Our inability to obtain needed financing or to generate sufficient cash from operations may require us to abandon projects or curtail planned investments in research and development or other strategic initiatives. If we curtail planned investments in research and development or abandon projects, our products may fail to remain competitive and our business would be materially adversely affected.
research and development
We are implementing a long-term business strategy to refocus our business to address markets beyond our core, PC market to the faster growing low power or dense server, embedded, and ultraportable and ultra-low-power markets. Currently, approximately 85% of our business is focused on the legacy PC portions of the market, projected to have slowing growth over the next several years. The goal of our long-term strategy is to drive 40% to 50% of our portfolio to faster growth markets in the long term. Despite our efforts, we may not be able to implement our strategy in a timely manner to exploit potential market opportunities or meet competitive challenges. Moreover, our business strategy is dependent on creating products that anticipate customer requirements and emerging industry trends. There can be no assurances that our new strategic direction will result in innovative products and technologies that provide value to our customers. In addition, we may be entering markets where current and new competitors may be able to adapt more quickly to customer requirements and emerging technologies. We cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against current or new competitors who may have stronger positions in these new markets. We may face delays or disruptions in research and development efforts, or we may be required to significantly invest greater resources in research and development than anticipated.

Computing Solutions operating loss was $231 million in 2012 compared to operating income of $556 million in 2011. The decline in operating results was primarily due to the decrease in revenue referenced above, partially offset by a $136 million decrease in marketing, general and administrative expenses, a $45 million decrease in research and development expenses and a $29 million decrease in cost of sales. Cost of sales decreased primarily due to lower unit shipments, partially offset by the $273 million LCM charge related to the fee for GFs waiver of a portion of our obligations and an inventory write-down of $100 million during the third quarter of 2012 as a result of lower than anticipated future demand for certain products, mainly first generation A-Series APU products, codenamed Llano. Marketing, general and administrative expenses and research and development expenses decreased for the reasons set forth under Expenses, below.
research and development
Computing Solutions operating income was $556 million in 2011 compared to $529 million in 2010. The improvement in operating results was primarily due to the increase in net revenue referenced above, partially offset by a $70 million increase in cost of sales, a $45 million increase in research and development expenses and a $42 million increase in marketing, general and administrative expenses. Cost of sales increased primarily due to higher microprocessor and chipsets unit shipments and the absence of a one-time benefit related to the deconsolidation of GF in 2010. Research and development expenses and marketing, general and administrative expenses increased for the reasons set forth under Expenses, below.

Research and Development Expenses
research and development
Research and development expenses of $1.4 billion in 2012, decreased by $99 million, or 7%, compared to $1.5 billion in 2011. The decrease was due to a $60 million decrease in research and development expenses attributable to our Graphics segment and a $45 million decrease in research and development expenses attributable to our Computing Solutions segment, partially offset by a $6 million increase in stock-based compensation expense recorded in the All Other category. Research and development expenses attributable to our Graphics segment decreased as a result of a $36 million decrease in product engineering and design costs, a $16 million decrease in other employee compensation and benefit expense and a $9 million decrease in manufacturing process technology expenses. The decrease in research and development expenses attributable to our Computing Solutions segment was primarily due to a $26 million decrease in other employee compensation and benefit expense, an $11 million decrease in manufacturing process technology expenses related to GF for our future products and a $9 million decrease in product engineering and design costs.
research and development
Research and development expenses of $1.5 billion in 2011, increased by $48 million, or 3%, compared to $1.4 billion in 2010. The increase was primarily due to a $45 million increase in research and development expenses attributable to our Computing Solutions segment as a result of a $79 million increase in product engineering and design costs for our future products, partially offset by a $27 million decrease in other employee compensation and benefit expense and a $7 million decrease in manufacturing process technology expenses related to GF for our future products.

Net cash provided by financing activities was $37 million in 2012 primarily due to net proceeds from the issuance of our 7.50% Notes of $491 million, $23 million from foreign grants from the Canadian government for research and development activities related to our AMD APU products and from the Malaysian and Chinese governments for our local microprocessor assembly, test and packaging facilities and $14 million from the issuance of common stock under our stock-based compensation plan, partially offset by our repayment of outstanding principal and accrued interest on our 5.75% Notes and repayment of capital lease obligations of $489 million.
research and development
Net cash used in financing activities was $6 million in 2011 as a result of payments of $202 million to repurchase $200 million aggregate principal amount of our 6.00% Notes. This amount was partially offset by $170 million of proceeds from our former financing arrangement with the IBM Parties, $20 million in proceeds from foreign grants from the Canadian government for research and development activities related to our AMD APU products and from the Malaysian and Chinese governments for our local microprocessor assembly, test and packaging facilities, and $18 million from the issuance of common stock under our stock-based compensation plan.

The developed technology of SeaMicro relates to SeaMicros SM10000 server offerings, which is built around a parallel array of independent ultra-low power processors, and it serves to integrate computation, switching, server management, and load balancing. In addition to developed technology, SeaMicro had in-process research and development projects, which were incomplete at the time of the acquisition. The value of developed technology and in-process research and development was determined based on the present value of estimated expected cash flows attributable to the technology. The customer relationships related to the ability to sell existing, in-process and future versions of the technology to SeaMicros existing customers and were valued based on incremental cash flows generated from the existing customer base. The trade name related to the SeaMicro brand names. The goodwill was primarily attributed to premiums paid for synergies between AMD and SeaMicro and the assembled workforce and is not deductible for tax purposes. The acquired developed technology, customer relationships and trade name are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. The acquired in-process research and development and goodwill associated with the acquisition are categorized as indefinite-lived intangible assets and subject to impairment review. Capitalized acquired in-process research and development costs will remain capitalized until such time as the projects are complete, at which point they will be amortized, or they will be written off when it is probable the projects will not be completed. As of December 29, 2012, approximately $5 million of in-process research and development projects were completed and classified as developed technology, and the Company started to amortize these projects on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives.

increases in deferred tax assets related to the net operating losses generated from pre-tax book losses net of the benefit relating to the SeaMicro acquisition. Purchase accounting for the SeaMicro acquisition required the establishment of a deferred tax liability related to the book tax basis differences of identifiable intangible assets that increased goodwill. The deferred tax liability created an additional source of U.S. future taxable income which resulted in a release of a portion of the Companys U.S. valuation allowance. In 2011, the net valuation allowance decreased by $245 million primarily for decreases in deferred tax assets related to the utilization of net operating losses due to pre-tax book income and a change in the book to tax basis in investments. In 2010, the net valuation allowance decreased by $56 million primarily for decreases in deferred tax assets related to the utilization of net operating losses due to pre-tax book income and the utilization of foreign research and development credits to offset prior period audit adjustments, net of an increase in U.S. deferred tax assets, primarily for foreign tax credits arising from withholding taxes.

Intel also leverages its dominance in the microprocessor market to sell its integrated chipsets. Intel manufactures and sells integrated graphics chipsets bundled with their microprocessors and is a dominant competitor with respect to this portion of our business. The continued improvement of the quality of Intels integrated graphics, along with higher unit shipments of our APU products, may drive computer manufacturers to reduce the number of systems they build paired with discrete graphics components, particularly for mobile PCs, because they may offer satisfactory graphics performance for most mainstream PC users, at a lower cost. Intel could also take actions that place our discrete GPUs at a competitive disadvantage, including giving one or more of our competitors in the graphics market, such as Nvidia Corporation, preferential access to its proprietary graphics interface or other useful information.

The health of the credit markets may adversely impact our ability to obtain financing when needed. In addition, any downgrades from credit rating agencies such as Moodys or Standard & Poors may adversely impact our ability to obtain external financing or the terms of such financing. Credit agency downgrades may also impact relationships with our suppliers, who may limit our credit lines. Our inability to obtain needed financing or to generate sufficient cash from operations may require us to abandon projects or curtail planned investments in research and development or other strategic initiatives. If we curtail planned investments in research and development or abandon projects, our products may fail to remain competitive and our business would be materially adversely affected.

Computing Solutions operating income was $556 million in 2011 compared to $529 million in 2010. The improvement in operating results was primarily due to the increase in net revenue referenced above, partially offset by a $70 million increase in cost of sales, a $45 million increase in research and development expenses and a $42 million increase in marketing, general and administrative expenses. Cost of sales increased primarily due to higher microprocessor and chipsets unit shipments and the absence of a one-time benefit related to the deconsolidation of GF in 2010. Research and development expenses and marketing, general and administrative expenses increased for the reasons set forth under Expenses, below.

Computing Solutions operating income was $529 million in 2010 compared to $142 million in 2009. The improvement was primarily due to the increase in net revenue referenced above and a $25 million decrease in cost of sales, partially offset by a $224 million increase in research and development expenses and a $61 million increase in marketing, general and administrative expenses. Cost of sales decreased due to reductions in manufacturing costs and a one-time benefit related to the deconsolidation of GF in 2010. Research and development expenses and marketing, general and administrative expenses increased for the reasons set forth under Expenses, below.

Research and Development Expenses
research and development
Research and development expenses of $1.5 billion in 2011, increased by $48 million, or 3%, compared to $1.4 billion in 2010. The increase was primarily due to a $45 million increase in research and development expenses attributable to our Computing Solutions segment as a result of a $79 million increase in product engineering and design costs for our future products, partially offset by a $27 million decrease in other employee compensation and benefit expense and a $7 million decrease in manufacturing process technology expenses related to GF for our future products.
research and development
Research and development expenses of $1.4 billion in 2010, decreased by $316 million, or 18%, compared to $1.7 billion in 2009. In 2009, research and development expenses included $524 million in research and development expenses related to the Foundry segment. Without taking into account the research and development expenses attributable to the Foundry segment, which are not indicative of our ongoing performance, research and development expenses would have increased by $208 million in 2010 as compared to 2009. This increase was due to a $224 million increase in research and development expenses attributable to our Computing Solutions segment and a $22 million increase in research and development expenses attributable to our Graphics segment, partially offset by a $38 million decrease in research and development expenses attributable to our All Other category. The increase in research and development expenses attributable to our Computing Solutions segment was primarily due to a $91 million increase in product engineering and design costs for our future products, a $68 million increase in employee compensation and benefit expense and a $64 million increase in manufacturing process technology expenses related to GF for our future products. The increase in research and development expenses attributable to our Graphics segment was primarily due to a $33 million increase in employee compensation and benefit expense, partially offset by a $13 million decrease in product engineering and design costs due to lower material costs used in 2010. The decrease in research and development expenses attributable to our All Other category was primarily due to lower research and development expenses related to handheld products because we no longer develop these products.
research and development
The income tax provision in 2010 was primarily due to withholding taxes paid to the Korean tax authorities in connection with the payment we received from Samsung in December 2010 pursuant to the Patent License and Settlement Agreement as well as foreign taxes in profitable locations offset by benefits, including the monetization of U.S. research and development credits, an alternative minimum tax refund on net operating loss carryback in the United States and the reversal of unrecognized tax benefits in foreign jurisdictions.
research and development
The income tax provision in 2009 was primarily due to a one-time loss of deferred tax assets for German net operating loss carryovers upon transfer of our ownership interests in our Dresden subsidiaries to GF plus foreign taxes in profitable locations offset by discrete tax benefits, including the monetization of U.S. research and development credits.

Net cash used in financing activities was $6 million in 2011 as a result of payments of $202 million to repurchase $200 million aggregate principal amount of our 6.00% Notes. This amount was partially offset by $170 million of proceeds from our former financing arrangement with the IBM parties, $20 million in proceeds from foreign grants from the Canadian government for research and development activities related to our AMD Fusion products and from the Malaysian and Chinese governments for our local microprocessor assembly, test and packaging facilities, and $18 million from the exercise of employee stock options. During 2011, we did not realize any excess tax benefit related to stock-based compensation. Therefore, we did not record any related financing cash flows.
research and development
Net cash provided by financing activities was $484 million in 2010 primarily as a result of proceeds of $988 million from our former financing arrangement with the IBM Parties, $490 million from the sale and issuance of $500 million aggregate principal amount of the 7.75% Notes, $19 million in proceeds from foreign grants from the Canadian government for research and development activities related to our Fusion products and from the Malaysian and Chinese governments for our local microprocessor assembly, test and packaging facilities and $15 million from the exercise of employee stock options. These amounts were partially offset by payments of $1,011 million to repurchase $1,016 million aggregate principal amount of our 6.00% Notes. During 2010, we did not realize any excess tax benefit related to stock-based compensation. Therefore, we did not record any related financing cash flows.
research and development
We currently estimate that we will pay GF approximately $1.5 billion in 2012 for wafer purchases. These 2012 estimated costs are based in part on our current expectations regarding GFs manufacturing yields and wafer volumes, and the successful conclusion of our negotiations with GF and ATIC related to a second amendment to the WSA, including the pricing methodology. Costs are also impacted by variations in yields and several other factors including our current expectations regarding demand for our products. In addition, we estimate that additional purchase obligations in connection with research and development related to GF wafer production will be approximately $71 million in 2012. We are not currently able to meaningfully quantify or estimate our purchase obligations to GF beyond 2012, but we expect that our future purchases from GF will continue to be material.

As of December 31, 2011, substantially all of the Companys U.S. and foreign deferred tax assets, net of deferred tax liabilities, continued to be subject to a valuation allowance. The realization of these assets is dependent on substantial future taxable income which, at December 31, 2011, in managements estimate, is not more likely than not to be achieved. In 2011, the net valuation allowance decreased by $245 million primarily for decreases in deferred tax assets related to the utilization of net operating losses due to pre-tax book income and a change in the book to tax basis in investments. In 2010, the net valuation allowance decreased by $56 million primarily for decreases in deferred tax assets related to the utilization of net operating losses due to pre-tax book income and the utilization of foreign research and development credits to offset prior period audit adjustments, net of an increase in U.S. deferred tax assets, primarily for foreign tax credits arising from withholding taxes. In 2009, the net valuation allowance decreased by $93 million primarily for decreases in deferred tax assets related to tax deductible goodwill, intangibles and discount of convertible notes.

continue to invest heavily in marketing, research and development, new manufacturing facilities and other technology companies. To the extent Intel manufactures a significantly larger portion of its microprocessor products using more advanced process technologies, or introduces competitive new products into the market before we do, we may be more vulnerable to Intels aggressive marketing and pricing strategies for microprocessor products.

Other than Intel, our principal competitor is Nvidia. AMD and Nvidia are the two principal players offering discrete graphics solutions. Other competitors include a number of smaller companies, which may have greater flexibility to address specific market needs, but less financial resources to do so, especially as we believe that the growing complexity of visual processors and the associated research and development costs represent an increasingly higher barrier to entry in this market.

efficiency of our microprocessors for servers. We are also focusing on delivering a range of low power integrated platforms to serve key markets, including commercial clients, mobile computing, and gaming and media computing. We believe that these integrated platforms will bring customers better time-to-market and increased performance and energy efficiency. We also work with industry leaders on process technology, software and other functional intellectual property and we work with others in the industry, public foundations, universities and industry consortia to conduct early stage research and development.

If we cannot generate sufficient revenues and operating cash flow or obtain external financing, we may face a cash shortfall and be unable to make all of our planned investments in research and development.
research and development
Although we make substantial investments in research and development, we cannot be certain that we will be able to develop, obtain or successfully implement new products and technologies on a timely basis. Our ability to fund research and development expenditures depends on generating sufficient cash flow from operations and the availability of external financing, if necessary. Our research and development expenditures, together with ongoing operating expenses, will be a substantial drain on our cash flow and may decrease our cash balances. If new competitors, technological advances by existing competitors or other competitive factors require us to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated in our research and development efforts, our operating expenses would increase. If we are required to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated in research and development efforts without an increase in revenue, our operating results could decline.
research and development
We regularly assess markets for external financing opportunities, including debt and equity financing. Additional debt or equity financing may not be available when needed or, if available, may not be available on satisfactory terms. The health of the credit markets may adversely impact our ability to obtain financing when needed. In addition, any downgrades from credit rating agencies such as Moodys or Standard & Poors may adversely impact our ability to obtain external financing or the terms of such financing. Credit agency downgrades may also impact relationships with our suppliers, who may limit our credit lines. Our inability to obtain needed financing or to generate sufficient cash from operations may require us to abandon projects or curtail planned investments in research and development. If we curtail planned investments in research and development or abandon projects, our products may fail to remain competitive and our business would be materially adversely affected.

Our main facility with respect to our graphics and chipset products is located in Markham, Ontario, Canada. This facility consists of approximately 240,000 square feet of office and research and development space. We occupy two other facilities in Markham, Ontario that comprise over 215,000 square feet, including approximately 65,000 square-feet of manufacturing and warehouse space. We also currently own and operate three microprocessor assembly and test facilities comprising an aggregate of 465,000 square feet. Our current microprocessor assembly and test facilities are located in Malaysia, Singapore and China and are described in further detail in the Assembly, Test, Mark and Packaging Facilities, above.

In June 2009, the FASB issued an amendment to improve financial reporting by enterprises involved with variable interest entities. This new guidance became effective for us beginning the first day of 2010. Under the new guidance, the investor who is deemed to both (i) have the power to direct the activities of the variable interest entity that most significantly impact the variable interest entitys economic performance and (ii) be exposed to losses and returns will be the primary beneficiary who should then consolidate the variable interest entity. We evaluated whether the governance changes described above would, pursuant to the new guidance, affect our consolidation of GF. We considered the purpose and design of GF, the activities of GF that most significantly affect the economic performance of GF and the concept of who has the power, as contemplated by the new guidance. Based on the results of this evaluation and in light of the governance changes whereby we believe we only had protective rights relative to the operations of GF, we concluded that the other investor in GF, ATIC, is the party who has the power to direct the activities of GF that most significantly impact GFs performance and is, therefore, the primary beneficiary of GF. Accordingly, effective as of December 27, 2009, we deconsolidated GF and started accounting for our ownership interest in GF under the equity method of accounting. For purposes of our application of the equity method of accounting during 2010, we recorded our share of GFs results, excluding the results of Chartered because GF did not have an equity ownership interest in Chartered. The terms of the Funding Agreement and the Wafer Supply Agreement described above were not affected by the deconsolidation of GF. Following the deconsolidation, GF became our related party. Our expenses related to GFs wafer manufacturing were $1.2 billion and related to GFs research and development activities were $114 million for the year ended December 25, 2010.
research and development
Computing Solutions operating income was $529 million in 2010 compared to $142 million in 2009. The improvement was primarily due to the increase in net revenue referenced above and a $25 million decrease in cost of sales, partially offset by a $224 million increase in research and development expenses and a $61 million increase in marketing, general and administrative expenses. Cost of sales decreased due to reductions in manufacturing costs and a one-time benefit related to the deconsolidation of GF in 2010. Research and development expenses and marketing, general and administrative expenses increased for the reasons set forth under Expenses, below.
research and development
Computing Solutions operating income was $142 million in 2009 compared to an operating loss of $458 million in 2008. Operating results for 2009 are not comparable to operating results for 2008 because of the creation of the Foundry segment in the first quarter of 2009, which resulted in our reporting certain research and development and marketing, general and administrative expenses in the Foundry segment that we would previously have reported in the Computing Solutions segment. Operating loss in 2008 included a $193 million gain on the sale of 200 millimeter equipment and $191 million of process technology license revenue that did not occur in 2009.

research and development
All Other operating income in 2010 was $170 million compared to $968 million in 2009. The decrease in operating results was primarily attributable to an absence of $1.2 billion of income from the settlement of our litigation with Intel in the fourth quarter of 2009 and the decrease in revenue referenced above, partially offset by $283 million of income from the settlement of our litigation with Samsung in the fourth quarter of 2010, a $77 million decrease in cost of sales, an absence of $65 million in restructuring charges, a $38 million decrease in research and development expenses, a $21 million decrease in marketing, general and administrative expenses and a $9 million decrease in amortization due to certain fully amortized acquired intangible assets. Cost of sales decreased primarily due to a one-time benefit recognized in the first quarter of 2010 related to the deconsolidation of GF and lower Handheld product unit shipments.

Research and development expenses of $1.4 billion in 2010, decreased by $316 million, or 18%, compared to $1.7 billion in 2009. In 2009, research and development expenses included $524 million in research and development expenses related to the Foundry segment. Without taking into account the research and development expenses attributable to the Foundry segment, which are not indicative of our ongoing performance, research and development expenses would have increased by $208 million in 2010 as compared to 2009. This increase was due to a $224 million increase in research and development expenses attributable to our Computing Solutions segment and a $22 million increase in research and development expenses attributable to our Graphics segment, partially offset by a $38 million decrease in research and development expenses attributable to our All Other category. The increase in research and development expenses attributable to our Computing Solutions segment was primarily due to a $91 million increase in product engineering and design costs for our future products, a $68 million increase in employee benefit and compensation expense and a $64 million increase in manufacturing process technology expenses related to GF for our future products. The increase in research and development expenses attributable to our Graphics segment was primarily due to a $33 million increase in employee benefit and compensation expense, partially offset by a $13 million decrease in product engineering and design costs due to lower material costs used in 2010. The decrease in research and development expenses attributable to our All Other category was primarily because of lower research and development expenses related to handheld products because we no longer develop these products.
research and development
Research and development expenses decreased $127 million, or 7%, from $1.8 billion in 2008 to $1.7 billion in 2009. This decrease was primarily due to a $193 million decrease in product engineering and design costs, which reflected our efforts to reduce operating expenses, and was partially offset by a $62 million increase in manufacturing process technology expenses mainly incurred by GF.
research and development
In 2009, GF applied for subsidies relating to certain research and development projects, and in 2008 we applied for these subsidies. We recorded these research and development subsidies in our consolidated financial statements as a reduction of research and development expenses when all conditions and requirements set forth in the subsidy allowance were met. The credit to research and development expenses was $46 million in 2009 and $36 million in 2008. With the deconsolidation of GF in 2010, we no longer record these credits in our consolidated financial statements.
research and development
The income tax provision in 2010 was primarily due to withholding taxes paid to the Korean tax authorities in connection with the payment we received from Samsung in December 2010 pursuant to the Patent License and Settlement Agreement as well as foreign taxes in profitable locations offset by benefits including the monetization of U.S. research and development credits, an alternative minimum tax refund on net operating loss carryback in the United States and the reversal of unrecognized tax benefits in foreign jurisdictions.
research and development
The income tax provision in 2009 was primarily due to a one-time loss of deferred tax assets for German net operating loss carryovers upon transfer of our ownership interests in the Dresden subsidiaries to GF plus foreign taxes in profitable locations offset by discrete tax benefits, including the monetization of U.S. research and development credits.
research and development
Net cash provided by financing activities was $484 million in 2010 primarily as a result of proceeds of $988 million from our financing arrangements with the IBM Parties, $490 million from the sale and issuance of $500 million aggregate principal amount of the 7.75% Notes, $19 million in proceeds from foreign grants from the Canadian government for research and development activities related to our Fusion products and from the Malaysian and Chinese governments for our local microprocessor assembly, test and packaging facilities and $15 million from the exercise of employee stock options. These amounts were partially offset by payments of $1,011 million to repurchase $1,016 million aggregate principal amount of our 6.00% Notes. During 2010, we did not realize any excess tax benefit related to stock-based compensation. Therefore, we did not record any related financing cash flows.

As of December 25, 2010, substantially all of the Companys U.S. and foreign deferred tax assets, net of deferred tax liabilities, continued to be subject to a valuation allowance. The realization of these assets is dependent on substantial future taxable income which, at December 25, 2010, in managements estimate, is not more likely than not to be achieved. In 2010, the net valuation allowance decreased by $56 million primarily for decreases in deferred tax assets related to the utilization of net operating losses due to pre-tax book income and the utilization of foreign research and development credits to offset prior period audit adjustments, net of an increase in U.S. deferred tax assets, primarily for foreign tax credits arising from withholding taxes. In 2009, the net valuation allowance decreased by $93 million primarily for decreases in deferred tax assets related to tax deductible goodwill, intangibles and discount of convertible notes. In 2008, the net valuation allowance increased by $1.1 billion primarily to provide valuation allowance for deferred tax assets related to tax deductible goodwill, intangibles and discount of convertible notes.

Intel has substantially greater financial resources than we do and accordingly spends substantially greater amounts on research and development and production capacity than we do. We expect Intel to maintain its dominant position and to continue to invest heavily in marketing, research and development, new manufacturing facilities and other technology companies. To the extent Intel manufactures a significantly larger portion of its microprocessor products using more advanced process technologies, or introduces competitive new products into the market before we do, we may be more vulnerable to Intels aggressive marketing and pricing strategies for microprocessor products. For example, Intel is transitioning to 32 nm process technology before us. Using more advanced process technology can contribute to lower product manufacturing costs and improve a products performance and power efficiency. We expect intense competition from Intel to continue.
development cost
Other than Intel, our principal competitor is Nvidia Corporation and to a lesser extent, Matrox Electronic Systems Ltd., Silicon Integrated Systems Corp. and Via Technologies, Inc. Along with AMD, Nvidia Corporation is the dominant player in discrete graphics solutions. Other competitors include a number of smaller companies, which may have greater flexibility to address specific market needs, but lesser financial resources to do so, especially as we believe that the growing complexity of visual processors and the associated research and development costs represent an increasingly high barrier to entry in this market.

We focus our research and development activities on improving and enhancing both product design and process technology. One main area of focus is on delivering the next generation of microprocessors with improved system performance and performance-per-watt characteristics. For example, we are focusing on improving the battery life of our microprocessors for notebook PCs and the power efficiency of our microprocessors for servers. We are also focusing on delivering a range of low power integrated platforms to serve key markets, including commercial clients, mobile computing, and gaming and media computing. We believe that these integrated platforms will bring customers better time-to-market and increased performance and energy efficiency. Longer-term, our research and development efforts are focused on implementing our vision of heterogeneous computing and the accelerated computing architecture in support of AMD Fusion. This includes greater system level integration of the CPU and GPU. We also work with other industry leaders on process
research and development
technology, software and other functional intellectual property such as wired and wireless networking, and we work with others in the industry, public foundations, universities and industry consortia to conduct early stage research and development.

Our research and development expenses (including GF research and development expenses) for 2009, 2008, and 2007 were approximately $1.7 billion, $1.8 billion and $1.8 billion. For more information, see Part II, Item 7Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, or MD&A.

If we cannot generate sufficient revenues and operating cash flow or obtain external financing, we may face a cash shortfall and be unable to make all of our planned investments in research and development.
research and development
Although we make substantial investments in research and development, we cannot be certain that we will be able to develop, obtain or successfully implement new products and technologies on a timely basis. Our
research and development
ability to fund research and development expenditures depends on generating sufficient cash flow from operations and the availability of external financing, if necessary. Our research and development expenditures, together with ongoing operating expenses, will be a substantial drain on our cash flow and may decrease our cash balances. If new competitors, technological advances by existing competitors or other competitive factors require us to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated in our research and development efforts, our operating expenses would increase. If we are required to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated in research and development efforts without an increase in revenue, our operating results could decline.
research and development
We regularly assess markets for external financing opportunities, including debt and equity financing. Additional debt or equity financing may not be available when needed or, if available, may not be available on satisfactory terms. The health of the credit markets may adversely impact our ability to obtain financing when needed. In addition, downgrades from credit rating agencies such as Moodys or Standard & Poors, which we experienced during the second quarter of 2009, may adversely impact our ability to get external financing or the terms of such financing. Credit agency downgrades may also impact relationships with our suppliers, who may limit our credit lines. Our inability to obtain needed financing or to generate sufficient cash from operations may require us to abandon projects or curtail planned investments in research and development. If we curtail planned investments in research and development or abandon projects, our products may fail to remain competitive and we would be materially adversely affected.

At December 26, 2009, we owned principal research and development, engineering, manufacturing, warehouse and administrative facilities located in the United States, Canada, China, Singapore and Malaysia. These facilities totaled approximately 2.4 million square feet.
research and development
Our main facility with respect to our graphics and chipset products is located in Markham, Ontario, Canada. This facility consists of approximately 240,000 square feet of office and research and development space. We occupy two other facilities in Markham, Ontario that comprise over 215,000 square feet, including approximately 65,000 square-feet of manufacturing and warehouse space. We also currently own and operate three microprocessor assembly and test facilities comprising an aggregate of approximately 1 million square feet. Our current microprocessor assembly and test facilities are located in Malaysia, Singapore and China and are described in further detail in the Manufacturing, Assembly and Test Facilities, above.

Our operating income for 2009 was $664 million compared to an operating loss of $2.0 billion in 2008. In 2008, the operating loss included a $193 million gain on the sale of 200 millimeter equipment, $191 million of process technology license revenue and $1.1 billion in impairment charges and charges related to the write-down of assets. In the fourth quarter of 2009, operating income included $1,242 million of income from the settlement of our litigation with Intel. Without the impact of these events, which we believe gives a more comparable view, our operating income would have improved $672 million due principally to a $437 million decrease in our research and development and marketing general and administrative expenses primarily due to the effect of our cost reduction initiatives.
research and development
Computing Solutions operating income was $127 million in 2009 compared to an operating loss of $461 million in 2008. Operating results for 2009 are not comparable to operating results for 2008 because of the creation of the Foundry segment in the first quarter of 2009, which resulted in our reporting certain research and development and marketing, general and administrative expenses in the Foundry segment that we would previously have reported in the Computing Solutions segment. Operating loss in 2008 included a $193 million gain on the sale of 200 millimeter equipment and $191 million of process technology license revenue that did not occur in 2009.
research and development
Computing Solutions operating loss was $461 million in 2008 compared to an operating loss of $712 million in 2007. The reduction in operating loss was due to the recognition of the $191 million of process technology license revenue referenced above, a $193 million gain on the sale of 200 millimeter equipment that did not occur in 2007, a $168 million decrease in cost of sales, and a $97 million decrease in marketing, general and administrative expenses partially offset by a $63 million increase in research and development expenses. Cost of sales decreased due to lower microprocessor unit volume and manufacturing cost reductions in 2008. The lower costs were partially offset by a $214 million incremental write-down of inventory related to Computing Solutions products in the fourth quarter of 2008. Research and development expenses increased and marketing, general and administrative expenses decreased for the reasons set forth under Expenses below.
research and development
Graphics operating income in 2008 was $12 million compared to an operating loss of $39 million in 2007. The $51 million operating improvement was due to the increase in revenue referenced above. The increase in revenue was partially offset by a $77 million increase in cost of sales because of higher GPU unit shipments and increased research and development and marketing, general and administrative expenses, which increased for the reasons set forth under Expenses below.
research and development
Research and Development Expenses
research and development
Research and development expenses decreased $127 million, or 7 percent, from $1.8 billion in 2008 to $1.7 billion in 2009. This decrease was primarily due to a $193 million decrease in product engineering and design costs, which reflected our efforts to reduce operating expenses, and was partially offset by a $62 million increase in manufacturing process technology expenses mainly incurred by GF. As a result of the deconsolidation of GF, we expect that our future research and development expenses will decrease.
research and development
Research and development expenses increased $77 million, or 4 percent, from $1,771 million in 2007 to $1,848 million in 2008. This increase was primarily due to a $63 million increase in research and development expenses attributable to the Computing Solutions segment and a $9 million increase in research and development expenses attributable to the Graphics segment. Research and development expenses for the Computing Solutions segment increased primarily due to higher product engineering and design costs for our next generation microprocessor products and start-up costs for our former manufacturing facility, Fab 38. Research and development expenses for the Graphics segment increased primarily due to higher product engineering and design costs.
research and development
From time to time, GF applies for subsidies relating to certain research and development projects. We recorded these research and development subsidies in our consolidated financial statements as a reduction of research and development expenses when all conditions and requirements set forth in the subsidy allowance are met. The credit to research and development expenses was $46 million in 2009, $36 million in 2008 and $30 million in 2007.
research and development
In the fourth quarter of 2007, pursuant to our accounting policy, we performed an annual impairment test of goodwill. As a result of this analysis, we concluded that the carrying amounts of goodwill included in our Graphics and former Consumer Electronics segments exceeded their implied fair values and recorded an impairment charge of approximately $1.26 billion, of which $913 million is included in the caption Impairment of goodwill and acquired intangible assets and $346 million is included in the caption Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax in our 2007 consolidated statement of operations. The impairment charge was determined by comparing the carrying value of goodwill assigned to the reporting units within these segments as of October 1, 2007, with the implied fair value of the goodwill. We considered both the income and market approaches in determining the implied fair value of the goodwill. While market valuation data for comparable companies was gathered and analyzed, we concluded that there was not sufficient comparability between the peer groups and the specific reporting units to allow for the derivation of reliable indications of value using a market approach, and therefore we ultimately employed the income approach which requires estimates of future operating results and cash flows of each of the reporting units, discounted using estimated discount rates ranging from 13 percent to 15 percent. The estimates of future operating results and cash flows were principally derived from an updated long-term financial forecast, which was developed as part of our strategic planning cycle conducted annually during the latter part of the third quarter of 2007. The decline in the implied fair value of the goodwill and resulting impairment charge was primarily driven by the updated long-term financial forecasts, which showed lower estimated near-term and longer-term profitability compared to estimates developed at the time of the completion of the ATI acquisition. The updated financial forecast for our Graphics segment was lower primarily because of intense pricing competition with Nvidia throughout 2007, which required an increase in sales and marketing activities to a greater extent than we previously forecasted. In addition, we had invested in the development of new graphics technologies to a greater extent than previously forecasted, which resulted in an increase in research and development expenses. Also, Intel announced its intention to develop a discrete graphics product. These factors resulted in lower near-term and longer-term forecasts of Graphics business revenues, operating profitability and cash flows compared to the forecasts at the time of the ATI acquisition.
research and development
We recorded an income tax provision of $112 million in 2009, $68 million in 2008 and $27 million in 2007. The income tax provision in 2009 was primarily due to a one-time loss of deferred tax assets for German net operating loss carryovers upon transfer of our ownership interests in the Dresden subsidiaries to GF plus foreign taxes in profitable locations offset by discrete tax benefits including the monetization of U.S. research and development credits. The income tax provision in 2008 primarily resulted from increases in net deferred tax liabilities in our former German subsidiaries reduced by net current tax benefits in other jurisdictions. The income tax provision in 2007 primarily resulted from current foreign taxes reduced by the reversal of deferred U.S. taxes related to indefinite-lived goodwill, resulting from the goodwill impairment charge we recorded during the year, and recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits for tax holidays.
research and development
As of December 26, 2009, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances were approximately $2.7 billion, which included $904 million of GFs cash and cash equivalents. Taking into account the 2010 deconsolidation of GF, we believe that cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances as of December 26, 2009, anticipated cash flow from operations and available external financing will be sufficient to fund operations, including capital expenditures of approximately $160 million over the next twelve months related to, among other things, IT, our assembly and test facilities and investments supporting research and development efforts, including AMD Fusion product development. In addition, our debt and capital lease obligations as of December 26, 2009 were $4.7 billion, of which $2.0 billion represented GF obligations. In 2009, without taking into account GFs indebtedness, we reduced our debt by approximately $1.2 billion.

The updated financial forecast for the Graphics segment was lower primarily because of intense pricing competition with its primary competitor throughout 2007 which required an increase in the Companys sales and marketing activities to a greater extent than previously forecasted. In addition, the Company had invested in the development of new graphics technologies to a greater extent than previously forecasted, which resulted in an increase in research and development expenses. Also the Companys primary microprocessor competitor announced its intention to develop a discrete graphics product. These factors resulted in lower near-term and

Intel has substantially greater financial resources than we do and accordingly spends substantially greater amounts on research and development and production capacity than we do. We expect Intel to maintain its dominant position and to continue to invest heavily in marketing, research and development, new manufacturing facilities and other technology companies. To the extent Intel manufactures a significantly larger portion of its microprocessor products using more advanced process technologies, or introduces competitive new products into the market before we do, we may be more vulnerable to Intels aggressive marketing and pricing strategies for microprocessor products. We expect intense competition from Intel to continue.

We focus our microprocessor research and development activities on product design and system and manufacturing process development. One main area of focus is on delivering the next generation of microprocessors with improved system performance and performance-per-watt characteristics. We have devoted significant resources to product design and to developing and improving manufacturing process technologies. We also work with other industry leaders, public foundations, universities and industry consortia to conduct early stage research and development.

With respect to graphics, our primary research and development objective is to develop products and technologies that meet the ever-changing demands of the PC industry on a timely basis so as to meet market windows. We are also focusing on delivering a range of integrated platforms to serve key markets, including commercial clients, mobile computing, and gaming and media computing. We believe that these integrated platforms will bring customers improved system stability, better time-to-market and increased performance and energy efficiency. Longer-term, our research and development efforts are focused on developing monolithic silicon solutions for specialized uses that are comprised of microprocessors, graphics processors and video processors.

Our research and development expenses for 2008, 2007, and 2006 were approximately $1.8 billion, $1.8 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively. However, research and development expenses for 2006 are not comparable to prior years because they included ATIs research and development expenses only from October 25, 2006 through December 31, 2006. For more information, see Part II, Item 7Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, or MD&A.

If we cannot generate sufficient revenues and operating cash flow or obtain external financing, we may face a cash shortfall and be unable to make all of our planned investments in research and development.
research and development
Although we make substantial investments in research and development, we cannot be certain that we will be able to develop, obtain or successfully implement new products and technologies on a timely basis. Our ability to fund research and development expenditures depends on generating sufficient cash flow from operations and the availability of external financing, if necessary. Our research and development expenditures, together with ongoing operating expenses, will be a substantial drain on our cash flow and may decrease our cash balances. If new competitors, technological advances by existing competitors or other competitive factors require us to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated in our research and development efforts, our operating expenses would increase. If we are required to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated in research and development efforts without an increase in revenue, our operating results could decline. During 2008, we incurred substantial losses that had a negative impact on cash balances. During 2008, net cash used in operating activities was $692 million. As of December 27, 2008, we had approximately $1.1 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities.
research and development
We regularly assess markets for external financing opportunities, including debt and equity financing. Additional debt or equity financing may not be available when needed or, if available, may not be available on satisfactory terms. The recent developments in the credit markets may adversely impact our ability to obtain financing when needed. Our inability to obtain needed financing or to generate sufficient cash from operations may require us to abandon projects or curtail planned investments in research and development. If we curtail planned investments in research and development or abandon projects, our products may fail to remain competitive and we would be materially adversely affected.
research and development
If we are unable to comply with the covenants in the subsidy grant documents that we receive from the State of Saxony, the Federal Republic of Germany and/or the European Union for Fab 30, Fab 36, Fab 38 or other research and development projects we may undertake in Germany, we may forfeit or have to repay our subsidies, which could materially adversely affect us.

At December 27, 2008, we owned principal engineering, manufacturing, warehouse and administrative facilities located in the United States, Canada, China, Germany, Singapore and Malaysia. These facilities totaled approximately 4.5 million square feet. Of this amount, 2.2 million square feet were located in Dresden, Germany and were used primarily for wafer fabrication, research and development, and administrative offices.

Our main facility with respect to our graphics and chipset products is located in Markham, Ontario, Canada. This facility consists of approximately 240,000 square feet of office and research and development space. We occupy five other facilities in Markham, Ontario that comprise over 265,000 square feet, including approximately 65,000 square-feet of manufacturing and warehouse space.

In November 2008 we launched our first 45-nanometer quad-core AMD Opteron processors, and we expect the transition to 45-nanometer process technology to be completed at Fab 36 by mid-2009. In 2008 and early 2009, we also introduced several new platform products such as our Puma and Yukon platforms for notebooks and our Dragon platform for desktop PCs. With respect to graphics products, we released the ATI Radeon HD 4000 series of products in June 2008. Despite the cost cutting efforts referenced above, one of our key priorities for 2009 is to continue to invest in research and development and to maintain the competitiveness of our product roadmap.

The value assigned to IPR&D was determined using a discounted cash flow methodology, specifically an excess earnings approach, which estimates value based upon the discounted value of future cash flows expected to be generated by the in-process projects, net of all contributory asset returns. The approach includes consideration of the importance of each project to the overall development plan and estimating costs to develop the purchased IPR&D into commercially viable products. The revenue estimates used to value the purchased IPR&D were based on estimates of the relevant market sizes and growth factors, expected trends in technology and the nature and expected timing of new product introductions by ATI and its competitors.
research and development
The updated financial forecast for our Graphics segment was lower primarily because of intense pricing competition with our primary competitor throughout 2007, which required an increase in sales and marketing activities to a greater extent than we previously forecasted. In addition, we had invested in the development of new graphics technologies to a greater extent than previously forecasted, which resulted in an increase in research and development expenses. Also, Intel announced its intention to develop a discrete graphics product. These factors resulted in lower near-term and longer-term forecasts of Graphics business revenues, operating profitability and cash flows compared to the forecasts at the time of the ATI acquisition.

In accordance with business combination accounting, we have allocated the purchase price of ATI to related tangible and intangible assets acquired, including in-process research and development, and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. These valuations require us to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to acquisition-related intangible assets.
research and development
We made estimates of fair value of the ATI assets acquired and liabilities assumed using reasonable assumptions based on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired company. Critical estimates in valuing certain of the acquisition-related intangible assets included but were not limited to: future expected cash flows from the sale of products, expected costs to develop in-process research and development projects into commercially viable products and estimated cash flows from the projects when completed; the markets awareness of the acquired companys brand and the acquired companys market position, as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired brand will continue to be used in the

Computing Solutions operating loss was $461 million in 2008 compared to an operating loss of $712 million in 2007. The reduction in operating loss was due to the recognition of the $191 million of process technology license revenue referenced above, a $193 million gain on the sale of 200 millimeter equipment that did not occur in 2007, a $168 million decrease in cost of sales, a $97 million decrease in marketing, general and administrative expenses partially offset by a $63 million increase in research and development expenses. See Part II, Item 7MD&AGain on sale of 200 millimeter equipment and the license of related process technology below, for additional information. Cost of sales decreased due to lower microprocessor unit volume and manufacturing cost reductions in 2008. The lower costs were partially offset by a $214 million incremental write-down of inventory related to Computing Solutions products in the fourth quarter of 2008. Research and development expenses increased and marketing, general and administrative expenses decreased for the reasons set forth under Expenses, below.
research and development
Computing Solutions operating loss was $712 million in 2007 compared to operating income of $679 million in 2006. The decline in operating results was primarily due to the $665 million decrease in revenue described above, a $307 million increase in manufacturing expenses, a $329 million increase in research and development expenses and a $91 million increase in marketing, general and administrative expenses. Research and development expenses and marketing, general and administrative expenses increased for the reasons set forth
research and development
Graphics operating income in 2008 was $12 million compared to an operating loss of $39 million in 2007. The $51 million operating improvement was due to the increase in revenue referenced above. The increase in revenue was partially offset by a $77 million increase in cost of sales because of higher unit shipments and increased research and development and marketing, general and administrative expenses, which increased for the reasons set forth under Expenses below.
research and development
All Other operating loss of $1.6 billion in 2007 increased $869 million compared to an operating loss of $690 million in 2006. The increase in operating loss was primarily attributable to ATI acquisition-related impairment charges of $1.1 billion, which included a goodwill write-down of $913 million and a write-down of acquired intangible assets of $219 million and an increase of $173 million in amortization of acquired intangible assets, partially offset by a decrease in ATI acquisition-related charges of $448 million. Acquisition-related charges in 2006 included a $416 million charge for acquired in-process research and development, which did not recur in 2007. See ATI Acquisition above, for additional information.

Research and Development Expenses
research and development
Research and development expenses increased $77 million, or 4 percent, from $1.8 billion in 2007 to $1.9 billion in 2008. This increase was primarily due to a $63 million increase in research and development expenses attributable to the Computing Solutions segment and a $9 million increase in research and development expenses attributable to our Graphics segment. Research and development expenses for the Computing Solutions segment increased primarily due to higher product engineering and design costs for our next generation microprocessor products and start-up costs for Fab 38. Research and development expenses for the Graphics segment increased primarily due to higher product engineering and design costs.
research and development
Research and development expenses increased $581 million, or 49 percent, from $1.2 billion in 2006 to $1.8 billion in 2007. The increase was primarily attributable to: a $329 million increase in research and development expenses attributable to our Computing Solutions segment and a $189 million increase in research and development expenses attributable to our Graphics segment. Research and development expenses attributable to our Computing Solutions segment increased due primarily to higher product engineering and design costs for our next generation microprocessor products. In addition, research and development expenses attributable to ATIs chipset business were included for the full year in 2007 compared to only nine weeks in 2006. Research and development expenses attributable to our Graphics segment increased primarily due to the inclusion of operations related to this segment for the full year in 2007 compared to nine weeks in 2006.
research and development
From time to time, we also apply for subsidies relating to certain research and development projects. These research and development subsidies are recorded as a reduction of research and development expenses when all conditions and requirements set forth in the subsidy grant are met. The credit to research and development expenses totaled $36 million in 2008, $30 million in 2007 and $27 million in 2006.

In-process research and development, amortization of acquired intangible assets and integration charges, and impairment of goodwill and acquired intangible assets.
research and development
In-process research and development charges of $416 million in 2006 related to projects acquired in connection with the acquisition of ATI. Amortization of acquired intangible assets and integration charges increased $169 million, or 252 percent, from $67 million in 2006 to $236 million in 2007. This increase was primarily attributable to a $173 million increase in amortization of acquired intangible assets, partially offset by a $4 million decrease in charges related to the integration of AMD and ATI operations. Amortization of acquired intangible assets increased primarily due to the inclusion of charges for the full year in 2007 compared to nine weeks in 2006. See Part II, Item 7 MD&AATI Acquisition above, for additional information.
research and development
Net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $1.3 billion in 2006. Our net loss of $166 million was adjusted for non-cash charges consisting primarily of $837 million of depreciation and amortization expense, $416 million for the write-off of in-process research and development expenses related to the ATI acquisition, stock-based compensation expense of $77 million, and $45 million related to an equity interest in the net loss of Spansion. These charges were partially offset by amortization of foreign grants and subsidies of $151 million. The net changes in our operating assets at December 31, 2006 compared to December 25, 2005 included an increase of $530 million in accounts payable and accrued liabilities, partially offset by a decrease in payables to related parties of $229 million and an increase of $175 million in other assets. The increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities was primarily related to higher purchases of raw materials, technology license payment obligations, and marketing accruals due to increased operations in the Computing Solutions segment. The decrease in payables to related parties is a result of our no longer shipping products and invoicing customers on behalf of Spansion after the second quarter of 2006. Prior to the second quarter of 2006, we shipped products to and invoiced Spansions customers in our name on behalf of Spansion and remitted the receipts to Spansion. The increase in other assets was primarily due to purchases of new technology licenses.

In connection with the receipt of investment grants for the Fab 36 project, AMD Fab 36 KG is required to attain a certain employee headcount by December 2008 and is required to maintain this headcount through December 2013. We record these grants as long-term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet and amortize them to operations ratably starting from December 2004 through December 2013. Initially, we amortized the grant amounts as a reduction to research and development expenses. Beginning in the first quarter of 2006 when Fab 36 began producing revenue generating products, we started amortizing these amounts as a reduction to cost of sales. Allowances are amortized as a reduction of depreciation expense ratably over the life of the investments because these allowances are intended to subsidize the capital investments. Noncompliance with the covenants contained in the subsidy documents could result in the repayment of all or a portion of the amounts received to date.

We expect Intel to maintain its dominant position in the microprocessor market and to continue to invest heavily in marketing, research and development, new manufacturing facilities and other technology companies. Intel has substantially greater financial resources than we do and accordingly spends substantially greater amounts on research and development and production capacity than we do. We expect intense competition from Intel to continue.

We focus our microprocessor research and development activities on product design and system and manufacturing process development. One main area of focus is on delivering the next generation of microprocessors with improved system performance and performance-per-watt characteristics. We have devoted significant resources to product design and to developing and improving manufacturing process technologies and plan to continue to do so in the future. We also work with other industry leaders, public foundations, universities and industry consortia to conduct early stage research and development.
research and development
With respect to graphics and chipsets and products for consumer electronics devices, our primary research and development objective is to develop products and technologies that meet the ever-changing demands of the PC and consumer electronics industries on a timely basis so as to meet market windows. We are also focusing on delivering a range of integrated platforms to serve key markets, including commercial clients, mobile computing, and gaming and media computing. We believe that these integrated platforms will bring customers improved system stability, better time-to-market and increased performance and energy efficiency. Longer-term, our research and development efforts are focused on developing monolithic silicon solutions for specialized uses that are comprised of microprocessors, graphics processors and video processors.

Our research and development expenses for 2007, 2006, and 2005 were approximately $1.8 billion, $1.2 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively. Research and development expenses for 2006 and 2007 included ATIs research and development expenses from October 25, 2006 through December 29, 2007. For more information, see Part II, Item 7Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, or MD&A.

We conduct our microprocessor manufacturing process development activities primarily through our joint development agreement with IBM. Under this agreement, we jointly develop new process technologies, including 45-nanometer, 32-nanometer, 22-nanometer and certain other advanced technologies, to be implemented on silicon wafers. Our relationship also includes laboratory-based research of emerging technologies such as new transistor, interconnect, lithography and die-to-package connection technologies. We pay fees to IBM for joint development projects. The actual amounts we pay to IBM are dependent upon the number of partners, including us and IBM, engaged in related development projects under the agreement. In addition, we agreed to pay IBM specified royalties upon the occurrence of specified events, including in the event that we sublicense the jointly developed process technologies to specified third parties or if we bump wafers for a third party. Bumping wafers is one of the final stages of the manufacturing process in which wafers are prepared for assembly and test. For more information on the fees paid or payable to IBM, see Part II, Item 7, Contractual Cash Obligations and GuaranteesUnconditional Purchase Commitments, and Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors. We cannot be certain that our substantial investments in research and development will lead to timely improvements in product designs or technology used to manufacture our products or that we will have sufficient resources to invest in the level of research and development that is required to remain competitive.
research and development
Under the agreement, our joint development relationship continues through December 31, 2011. Our agreement with IBM may be extended further by the mutual agreement of the parties and can also be terminated immediately by either party if the other party permanently ceases doing business, becomes bankrupt or insolvent, liquidates or undergoes a change of control or can be terminated by either party upon 30 days written notice upon a failure of the other party to perform a material obligation thereunder. Under our agreement, research and development takes place in IBMs Watson Research Center in Yorktown Heights, N.Y., the Center for Semiconductor Research at Albany NanoTech, and at IBMs 300-millimeter manufacturing facility in East Fishkill, N.Y.
research and development
We conduct research and development activities for our graphics products, chipset products and products for consumer electronics devices at design centers located throughout the world, including in the United States, Canada, India, Finland and China. Due to the rapid pace of technological change in the graphics industry, our strategy is to focus on developing the newest generation of products that meet market and customer requirements on a timely basis so as to meet each market window.

Should we choose to build the facility, the State of New York is required to issue bonds or otherwise fund the project and related research and development in the amount of $650 million. Actual disbursement of funds occurs as we submit appropriate documentation verifying that expenditures on the project have been incurred. If we move forward with the project, we must complete the construction of the facility in accordance with the final plans and specifications approved in writing by the ESDC and must maintain business operations on the Luther Forest Technology Campus for a minimum of seven years after the date full employment at the facility is first achieved. Funds disbursed to us may be subject to repayment, in whole or part, if we do not attain and or maintain certain levels of employment for specified periods of time.
research and development
We expect Intel to maintain its dominant position and to continue to invest heavily in marketing, research and development, new manufacturing facilities and other technology companies. Intel has substantially greater financial resources than we do and accordingly spends substantially greater amounts on research and development and production capacity than we do. Moreover, Intel launched its quad-core multi-chip module processors during the fourth quarter of 2006. We commenced initial shipments of our first quad-core products for servers in August 2007 and for desktop PCs in November 2007. However, we did not ship significant volumes of these products in 2007, but we expect to ship in more significant volumes in the first half of 2008. To the extent Intel manufactures a significantly larger portion of its microprocessor products using more advanced process technologies, or introduces competitive new products into the market before we do, we may be more vulnerable to Intels aggressive marketing and pricing strategies for microprocessor products.
research and development
We cannot be certain that our substantial investments in research and development will lead to timely improvements in product designs or technology used to manufacture our products or that we will have sufficient resources to invest in the level of research and development that is required to remain competitive.
research and development
We make substantial investments in research and development for process technologies in an effort to design and manufacture leading-edge microprocessors. We also make substantial investments in research and development related to product designs, including new integrated platforms and our design initiative called Fusion, and we anticipate that we will continue to invest in research and development in the future. We cannot be certain that we will be able to develop, obtain or successfully implement leading-edge process technologies needed to manufacture future generations of our products profitably or on a timely basis or that our competitors will not develop new technologies, products or processes that render our products uncompetitive or obsolete. If new competitors, technological advances by existing competitors or other competitive factors require us to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated in our research and development efforts, our operating expenses would increase. If we are required to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated in research and development efforts without an increase in revenue, our operating results could decline. Moreover, in connection with the ATI acquisition, we committed to the Minister of Industry of Canada to increase total expenditures on research and development in Canada when compared to ATIs expenditures in this area in prior years. However, we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient resources to achieve planned investments in research and development or to otherwise maintain the level of investment in research and development that is required for us to remain competitive.
development cost
If this agreement were to be terminated, we would have to substantially increase our research and development activities internally, which could significantly increase our research and development costs, and we could experience delays or other setbacks in the development of new process technologies, any of which would materially adversely affect us. Moreover, the timely achievement of the milestones set forth in the joint development agreement is critical to our ability to continue to manufacture microprocessors using advanced process technologies.

We receive capital investment grants and allowances from the State of Saxony and the Federal Republic of Germany for Fab 36. We have also received capital investment grants and allowances as well as interest subsidies from these governmental entities for Fab 30. From time to time, we also apply for and obtain subsidies from the State of Saxony, the Federal Republic of Germany and the European Union for certain research and development projects. The subsidy grant documents typically contain covenants that must be complied with, and noncompliance with the conditions of the grants, allowances and subsidies could result in the forfeiture of all or a portion of any future amounts to be received, as well as the repayment of all or a portion of amounts received to date. If we are unable to comply with any of the covenants in the grant documents, we could be materially adversely affected.

At December 29, 2007, we owned principal engineering, manufacturing, warehouse and administrative facilities located in the United States, Canada, China, Germany, Singapore and Malaysia. These facilities totaled approximately 3.6 million square feet. Of this amount, 2.2 million square feet were located in Dresden, Germany and were used primarily for wafer fabrication, research and development, and administrative offices.

Of the total purchase price, approximately $416 million was allocated to in-process research and development (IPR&D) and was expensed in the fourth quarter of 2006. Projects that qualify as IPR&D represent those that have not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use at the time of the acquisition. These projects include development of next generation GPU, chipset, handheld and digital TV products. As of the date of acquisition, the estimated fair value of the projects for the Graphics and Chipsets segment was approximately $193 million ($122 million for graphics products and $71 million for chipset products) and we expect to incur an aggregate of approximately $113 million ($86 million for graphics products and $27 million for chipset products) to complete these projects over the two-year period that commenced October 25, 2006. As of the date of the acquisition, the estimated fair value of the projects for the Consumer Electronics segment was approximately $223 million, and we expect to incur aggregate costs of approximately $102 million to complete these projects over the two-year period that commenced October 25, 2006. Starting in the first quarter of 2007, in conjunction with the integration of ATIs operations, we reported operations related to our chipset products in our Computing Solutions segment.

Of the total purchase price, approximately $416 million was allocated to in-process research and development (IPR&D) and was expensed in the fourth quarter of 2006. Projects that qualify as IPR&D represent those that have not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use at the time of the acquisition. These projects include development of next generation GPU, chipset, handheld and digital TV products. As of the date of acquisition, the estimated fair value of the projects for the Graphics and Chipsets segment was approximately $193 million ($122 million for graphics products and $71 million for chipset products) and we expect to incur an aggregate of approximately $113 million ($86 million for graphics products and $27 million for chipset products) to complete these projects over the two-year period that commenced October 25, 2006.

Starting in the first quarter of 2007, in conjunction with the integration of ATIs operations, we reported operations related to our chipset products in our Computing Solutions segment.
r&d
The value assigned to IPR&D was determined using a discounted cash flow methodology, specifically an excess earnings approach, which estimates value based upon the discounted value of future cash flows expected to be generated by the in-process projects, net of all contributory asset returns. The approach includes consideration of the importance of each project to the overall development plan and estimating costs to develop the purchased IPR&D into commercially viable products. The revenue estimates used to value the purchased IPR&D were based on estimates of the relevant market sizes and growth factors, expected trends in technology and the nature and expected timing of new product introductions by ATI and its competitors.
r&d
The estimates used in valuing IPR&D were based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain, and as a result, actual results may differ from estimates.
research and development
In accordance with business combination accounting, we have allocated the purchase price of ATI to tangible and acquisition related intangible assets acquired, including in-process research and development, and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. These valuations require us to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to acquisition related intangible assets.
research and development
We made estimates of fair value of the ATI assets acquired and liabilities assumed using reasonable assumptions based on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired company. Critical estimates in valuing certain of the acquisition related intangible assets included but were not limited to: future expected cash flows from the sale of products, expected costs to develop in-process research and development projects into commercially viable products and estimated cash flows from the projects when completed; the markets awareness of the acquired companys brand and the acquired companys market position, as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired brand will continue to be used in the combined companys product portfolio and discount rates. Unanticipated events may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results as evidenced by the impairment charges we recorded with respect to goodwill and intangible assets resulting from the ATI acquisition.

Computing Solutions operating loss was $670 million in 2007 compared to operating income of $680 million in 2006. The operating loss was primarily due to the $665 million decrease in revenue described above, a $307 million increase in manufacturing expenses, a $309 million increase in research and development expenses and a $69 million increase in marketing, general and administrative expenses. Research and development expenses and marketing, general and administrative expenses increased for the reasons set forth under Expenses, below. Manufacturing expenses increased primarily due to increased volumes of microprocessors, a shift to higher-end microprocessors and the inclusion of ATIs chipset business in the Computing Solutions segment for a full year in 2007, as opposed to only nine weeks in 2006.
research and development
Computing Solutions operating income of $680 million in 2006 increased by $94 million, or 16 percent, compared to operating income of $586 million in 2005. This increase was primarily due to a 38 percent increase in net revenue, partially offset by an increase in manufacturing expenses of $856 million, an increase in marketing, general and administrative expenses of $265 million and an increase in research and development expenses of $219 million. Manufacturing expenses increased primarily to support higher sales volume. Research and development expenses and marketing, general and administrative expenses increased for the reasons set forth under Expenses, below.
research and development
All Other operating loss of $2.1 billion in 2007 increased by $1.4 billion compared to an operating loss of $720 million in 2006. The increase in operating loss was primarily attributable to ATI acquisition-related impairment charges of $1.6 billion, which included a goodwill write-down of $1.3 billion and a write-down of specific intangible assets of $349 million and an increase of $224 million in amortization of acquired intangible assets, partially offset by a decrease in ATI integration charges of $453 million. Integration charges in 2006 included $416 million in expenses for acquired in-process research and development, which did not recur in 2007. See Part II, Item 7 MD&AATI Acquisition.
research and development
All Other operating loss of $720 million in 2006 increased by $677 million compared to an operating loss of $43 million in 2005. The increase in operating loss was primarily attributable to ATI acquisition-related charges of $557 million and an increase in employee stock-based compensation expense and profit sharing expense of $104 million. ATI acquisition-related charges included an in-process research and development write-off of $416 million, amortization of acquired intangible assets of $47 million, cost of fair value adjustments to acquired inventory of $62 million and a $32 million charge associated with the integration of ATIs operations, which included termination of some AMD employees, cancellation of some existing contractual obligations and other costs that we incurred to integrate the operations of the two companies.

Research and Development Expenses
research and development
Research and development expenses increased $642 million, or 53 percent, from $1.2 billion in 2006 to $1.8 billion in 2007. The increase was primarily attributable to: a $309 million increase in research and development expenses attributable to our Computing Solutions segment, a $186 million increase in research and development expenses attributable to our Graphics segment and a $149 million increase in research and development expenses attributable to our Consumer Electronics segment. Research and development expenses attributable to our Computing Solutions segment increased due primarily to higher product design costs for our next generation microprocessor products. In addition, research and development expenses attributable to ATIs chipset business were included for the full year in 2007 compared to only nine weeks in 2006. Research and development expenses attributable to our Graphics and Consumer Electronics segments increased primarily due to the inclusion of operations related to these segments for the full fiscal year in 2007 compared to nine weeks in 2006.
development cost
Research and development expenses increased $61 million, or 5 percent, from $1.1 billion in 2005 to $1.2 billion in 2006. This increase was primarily attributable to: a $219 million increase in research and development expenses attributable to our Computing Solutions segment primarily due to an increase in silicon design, platform and product development costs for our microprocessor products partially offset by a $10 million lower corporate bonus expense, increases of $42 million and $31 million, respectively due to the consolidation of research and development expenses attributable to our Graphics and Consumer Electronics segments from October 25, 2006 through December 31, 2006, and a $51 million increase in stock-based compensation and profit sharing expenses. Fiscal 2006 research and development expenses were partially offset by the absence of research and development expenses related to Spansions operations because we did not consolidate Spansions results of operations into ours in 2006. In 2005, research and development expenses attributable to our Memory Products segment were $290 million.

From time to time, we also apply for and obtain subsidies from the State of Saxony, the Federal Republic of Germany and the European Union for certain research and development projects. We record the amortization of the research and development related grants and allowances, as well as the research and development subsidies, as a reduction of research and development expenses when all conditions and requirements set forth in the subsidy grant are met. The credit to research and development expenses totaled $30 million in 2007, $27 million in 2006, and $44 million in 2005.

Net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $1.3 billion in 2006. Our net loss of $166 million was adjusted for non-cash charges consisting primarily of $837 million of depreciation and amortization expense, $416 million for the write-off of in-process research and development expenses related to the ATI acquisition, stock-based compensation expense of $77 million, and $45 million related to an equity interest in the net loss of Spansion. These charges were partially offset by amortization of foreign grants and subsidies of $151 million. The net changes in our operating assets at December 31, 2006 compared to December 25, 2005 included an increase of $530 million in accounts payable and accrued liabilities, partially offset by a decrease in payables to related parties of $229 million and an increase of $175 million in other assets. The increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities was primarily related to higher purchases of raw materials, technology license payment obligations, and marketing accruals due to increased operations in the Computing Solutions segment. The decrease in payables to related parties is a result of our no longer shipping products and invoicing customers on behalf of Spansion after the second quarter of 2006. Prior to the second quarter of 2006, we shipped products to and invoiced Spansions customers in our name on behalf of Spansion and remitted the receipts to Spansion. The increase in other assets was primarily due to purchases of new technology licenses.

In connection with the receipt of investment grants for the Fab 36 project, AMD Fab 36 KG is required to attain a certain employee headcount by December 2008 and is required to maintain this headcount through December 2013. We record these grants as long-term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet and amortize them to operations ratably starting from December 2004 through December 2013. Initially, we amortized the grant amounts as a reduction to research and development expenses. Beginning in the first quarter of 2006 when Fab 36 began producing revenue generating products, we started amortizing these amounts as a reduction to cost of sales. For allowances, starting from the first quarter of 2006, we amortize the amounts as a reduction of depreciation expense ratably over the life of the investments because these allowances are intended to subsidize the capital investments. Noncompliance with the covenants contained in the subsidy documents could result in the repayment of all or a portion of the amounts received to date.

However, we are not obligated to commence construction, and our decision regarding proceeding with the construction is dependent on business conditions and market demand. Should we choose to build the facility, the State of New York is required to issue bonds or otherwise fund the project and related research and development in the amount of $650 million. Actual disbursement of funds occurs as we submit appropriate documentation verifying that expenditures on the project have been incurred. If we move forward with the project, we must complete the construction of the facility in accordance with the final plans and specifications approved in writing by ESDC and must maintain business operations on the Luther Forest Technology Campus for a minimum of seven years after the date full employment at the facility is first achieved. Funds disbursed to us may be subject to repayment, in whole or part, if we do not attain and or maintain certain levels of employment for specified periods of time.

We expect Intel to maintain its dominant position and to continue to invest heavily in marketing, research and development, new manufacturing facilities and other technology companies. Intel has substantially greater financial resources than we do and accordingly spends substantially greater amounts on research and development and production capacity than we do. Moreover, Intel currently manufactures a large portion of its processors using 65-nanometer technology whereas we only began commercial shipments of processors

We make substantial investments in research and development for process technologies in an effort to design and manufacture leading-edge microprocessors. We cannot be certain that we will be able to develop, obtain or successfully implement leading-edge process technologies needed to manufacture future generations of our products profitably or on a timely basis or that our competitors will not develop new technologies, products or processes that render our products uncompetitive or obsolete. We also make substantial investments in research and development related to product design and anticipate that we will continue to do so in the future. For example, we recently opened a research and development facility in Shanghai and an advanced microprocessor development facility in Fort Collins, Colorado. Similarly, in connection with the recent acquisition of ATI, we plan to continue to invest in research and development related to our graphics and chipset products and products for consumer electronics devices, including new integrated platforms and our design initiative called Fusion. Moreover, in connection with the acquisition, we committed to the Minister of Industry of Canada to increase total expenditures on research and development in Canada when compared to

r&d
Of the total purchase price, approximately $416 million was allocated to in-process research and development (IPR&D) and was expensed in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2006. Projects that qualify as IPR&D represent those that have not reached technological feasibility and have no alternative future use at the time of the acquisition. The value assigned to IPR&D was determined using a discounted cash flow methodology, specifically an excess earnings approach, which estimates value based upon the discounted value of future cash flows expected to be generated by the in-process projects, net of all contributory asset returns. The approach includes consideration of the importance of each project to the overall development plan, estimating costs to develop the purchased IPR&D into commercially viable products. The revenue estimates used to value the purchased IPR&D were based on estimates of the relevant market sizes and growth factors, expected trends in technology and the nature and expected timing of new product introductions by ATI and its competitors.

The estimates used in valuing these IPR&D were based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable, and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates.
research and development
In accordance with business combination accounting, we have allocated the purchase price of ATI to tangible and acquisition related intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed as well as to in-process research and development based on their estimated fair values. These valuations require us to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to acquisition related intangible assets.
research and development
We make estimates of fair value using reasonable assumptions based on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired company. Critical estimates in valuing certain of the acquisition related intangible assets include but are not limited to: future expected cash flows from sale of products, expected costs to develop in-process research and development projects into commercially viable products and estimated cash flows from the projects when completed; the markets awareness of the acquired companys brand and the acquired companys market position, as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired brand will continue to be used in the combined companys product portfolio; and discount rates. Unanticipated events may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results.

research and development
Computation Products operating income of $641 million in 2005 increased by $361 million, or 129 percent, compared to operating income of $280 million in 2004. This increase was primarily due to a 50 percent increase in net revenue whereas cost of sales increased by only 45 percent. Partially offsetting this increase was an increase in marketing, general and administrative expense of $199 million and an increase in research and development expenses of $203 million.
research and development
Embedded Products operating loss of $18 million in 2006 decreased $37 million as compared to an operating loss of $55 million in 2005. The decrease in operating loss was primarily due to a $20 million decrease in research and development expenses and $12 million in sales of products that we had previously written off.
research and development
All Other operating loss of $722 million in 2006 increased by $679 million compared to an operating loss of $43 million in 2005. The increase in operating loss was primarily attributable to ATI acquisition-related charges of $557 million and an increase in employee stock-based compensation expense and profit sharing expense of $104 million. The ATI acquisition-related charges include the in-process research and development write-off of $416 million, amortization of acquired intangible assets of $47 million, cost of fair value adjustments to acquired inventory of $62 million and a $32 million charge associated with the integration plan which included termination of some AMD employees, cancellation of some existing contractual obligations and other costs that we incurred to integrate the operations of the two companies.

Research and Development Expenses
development cost
Research and development expenses increased $61 million, or 5 percent, from $1,144 million in 2005 to $1,205 million in 2006. This increase was primarily attributable to: a $222 million increase in research and development expenses attributable to our Computation Products segment primarily due to an increase in silicon design, platform and product development costs for our microprocessor products, a $90 million increase due to the consolidation of ATIs research and development expenses from October 25, 2006, and a $39 million increase in stock-based compensation, corporate bonus and profit sharing expenses. Research and development expenses were partially offset by the absence of Spansion research and development expenses because we did not consolidate Spansions results of operations into ours in 2006. In 2005, research and development expenses attributable to our Memory Products segment were $290 million.

The 2002 Restructuring Plan resulted in the consolidation of facilities, primarily at our Sunnyvale, California site and at sales offices worldwide. We vacated and are attempting to sublease certain facilities that we currently occupy under long-term operating leases through 2011. We also terminated the implementation of certain partially completed enterprise resource planning software and other information technology implementation activities, resulting in the abandonment of certain software, hardware and capitalized development costs.

We had Canadian federal and provincial tax operating loss carry-forwards of approximately $31 million. These losses expire in 2026. We also had Canadian investment tax credits of approximately $139 million. $72 million of these investment tax credits expires in 2012 and 2013 with the remainder expiring by 2026. We also had Canadian federal and provincial research and development pools of $523 million and $275 million, respectively, which are not subject to expiration.

Net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $1.3 billion in 2006. Net loss of $166 million was adjusted for non-cash charges consisting primarily of $837 million of depreciation and amortization expense, $416 million for the write-off of in-process research and development expenses related to the ATI acquisition, stock-based compensation expense of $77 million, and $45 million related to an equity interest in the net loss of Spansion. These charges were offset by amortization of foreign grants and subsidies of $151 million. The net changes in operating assets at December 31, 2006 compared to December 25, 2005 included a decrease in payables to related parties of $229 million because we no longer ship products and invoice customers on behalf of Spansion. Prior to the second quarter of 2006, we shipped products to and invoiced Spansions customers in our name on behalf of Spansion and remitted the receipts to Spansion. The increase in other assets was primarily due to purchases of new technology licenses. The increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $530 million was primarily related to higher purchases of raw materials, future payment of technology licenses, and marketing accruals due to increased operations in the Computation Products segment.

In connection with the receipt of subsidies for the Fab 36 project, AMD Fab 36 KG is required to attain a certain employee headcount by December 2007 and maintain this headcount through December 2012. We record the subsidies as long-term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet and amortize them to operations ratably starting from December 2004 through December 2012. Initially, we amortized the grant amounts as a reduction to research and development expenses. Beginning in the first quarter of 2006 when Fab 36 began producing revenue generating products, we started amortizing these amounts as a reduction to cost of sales. For allowances, starting from the first quarter of 2006, we amortize the amounts as a reduction of depreciation expense ratably

Operating expenses increased due primarily to an increase in marketing and cooperative advertising costs of $79 million in connection with our AMD64-based processors, a nine percent increase in unit shipments, and a $28 million increase in research and development costs. The increase in research and development costs was due primarily to a $29 million increase in Fab 36 start-up costs and a $24 million increase in product design and engineering costs related to future generations of our microprocessors offset by a $23 million decrease in Fab 30 research and development activities.

Research and Development Expenses
research and development
Research and development expenses of $1,144 million in 2005 increased 22 percent from $935 million in 2004 due primarily to an increase of $103 million in product design and process improvement costs for new generations of our microprocessors and increased start-up costs associated with the Fab 36 project of $96 million.
research and development
Research and development expenses of $935 million in 2004 increased ten percent from $852 million in 2003 due in part to higher research and development expenses as a result of the consolidation of Spansion LLCs results of operations with our results of operations effective June 30, 2003, increased start-up costs associated with the Fab 36 project of approximately $29 million and a $24 million increase in product design and engineering costs for new generations of our microprocessors. These factors were partially offset by a $23 million decrease in Fab 30 research and development activities.
research and development
From time to time, we also apply for and obtain subsidies from the State of Saxony, the Federal Republic of Germany and the European Union for certain research and development projects. We record the amortization of the research and development related grants and allowances as well as the research and development subsidies as a reduction of research and development expenses when all conditions and requirements set forth in the subsidy grant are met. The credit to research and development expenses totaled $44 million in 2005, $21 million in 2004 and $29 million in 2003.

The 2002 Restructuring Plan resulted in the consolidation of facilities, primarily at our Sunnyvale, California site and at sales offices worldwide. We vacated and are attempting to sublease certain facilities currently occupied under long-term operating leases through 2011. We also terminated the implementation of certain partially completed enterprise resource planning (ERP) software and other information technology implementation activities, resulting in the abandonment of certain software, hardware and capitalized development costs.
research and development
In connection with the receipt of subsidies for the Fab 36 project, AMD Fab 36 KG is required to attain a certain employee headcount by December 2007 and maintain this headcount through December 2012. We record the subsidies as long-term liabilities on our financial statements and amortize them to operations ratably starting from December 2004 through December 2012. Currently, we amortize the grant amounts as a reduction to research and development expenses. At such time as Fab 36 begins producing revenue-generating products, which is expected to be in the first quarter of 2006, we will amortize these amounts as a reduction to cost of sales. For allowances, we will amortize the amounts as a reduction of depreciation expense ratably over the life of the equipment, starting from the first quarter of 2006 because these allowances are intended to subsidize the capital investments in equipment. Noncompliance with the covenants contained in the subsidy grant documents could result in forfeiture of all or a portion of the future amounts to be received, as well as the repayment of all or a portion of amounts received to date.
research and development
Also, during the first quarter of 2006, we expect operating expenses, which include research and development expenses and marketing, sales and administrative expenses, to increase by approximately 6 percent from comparable operating expenses in the fourth quarter of 2005, which excludes those operating expenses related to the Memory Products segment.
research and development
We expect Intel to maintain its dominant position in the microprocessor market and to continue to invest heavily in marketing, research and development, new manufacturing facilities and other technology companies.
research and development
Intel has substantially greater financial resources than we do and accordingly spends substantially greater amounts on research and development and production capacity than we do. Moreover, Intel currently manufactures certain of its microprocessor products on 300-millimeter wafers using 65-nanometer process technology whereas we expect to make our first production shipments of products manufactured on 300-millimeter wafers using 90-nanometer process technology in the first quarter of 2006. We expect to begin commercial shipments of microprocessors manufactured using 65-nanometer technology by the end of 2006. To the extent Intel manufactures its microprocessor products on larger wafers and smaller process technologies earlier than we do, we may be more vulnerable to Intels aggressive marketing and pricing strategies for microprocessor products, which may result in market share gains for Intel. Intels dominant position in the microprocessor market, its existing relationships with top-tier OEMs and its aggressive marketing and pricing strategies could result in lower unit sales and average selling prices for our products, which could have a material adverse effect on us.

We make substantial investments in research and development for process technologies in an effort to design and manufacture leading-edge microprocessors. We cannot be certain that we will be able to develop, obtain or successfully implement leading-edge process technologies needed to manufacture future generations of our products profitably or on a timely basis or that our competitors will not develop new technologies, products or processes that render our products uncompetitive or obsolete. Furthermore, we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient resources to maintain the level of investment in research and development that is required for us to remain competitive.

For example, we have a joint development agreement with IBM, pursuant to which we have agreed to work together to develop new process technologies through December 31, 2011. However, capital purchases by IBM necessary for the continued development of process development projects past December 31, 2008 are conditioned upon the approval by IBMs board of directors. If such approval is not received by September 30, 2007, either party has the right to terminate the agreement effective December 31, 2008 without liability. We anticipate that under this agreement, from December 25, 2005 through December 25, 2011, we would pay fees to IBM of between $502 million and $562 million in connection with joint development projects. In addition, from the beginning of 2002 through December 25, 2005, we paid $339 million to IBM in connection with agreements and services related to license grants and research and development activities.
development cost
If this agreement were to be terminated, we would either have to resume certain research and development activities internally or find an alternate partner. In either case, our research and development costs could increase, and we could experience delays or other setbacks in the development of new process technologies, any of which would materially adversely affect us. Moreover, the timely achievement of the milestones set forth in the joint development agreement is critical to our ability to continue to manufacture microprocessors at Fab 36 using advanced process technologies.

From time to time, we also apply for and obtain subsidies from the State of Saxony, the Federal Republic of Germany and the European Union for certain research and development projects. The subsidy grant documents typically contain covenants that must be complied with, and noncompliance with the conditions of the grants, allowances and subsidies could result in the forfeiture of all or a portion of any future amounts to be received, as well as the repayment of all or a portion of amounts received to date. If we are unable to comply with any of the covenants in the grant documents, we may be materially adversely affected.

As part of the June 30, 2003 transaction, the Company and Fujitsu entered into various service contracts separately with Spansion LLC. The Company provided, among other things, certain information technology, facilities, logistics, legal, tax, finance, human resources, and environmental health and safety services to Spansion LLC. Under these contracts, Fujitsu provided, among other things, certain information technology, research and development, quality assurance, insurance, facilities, environmental, and human resources services primarily to Spansion LLCs Japanese subsidiary, Spansion Japan. Fees earned by the Company and incurred by Spansion LLC or its subsidiaries for these services during the period June 30, 2003 to December 20, 2005 were eliminated in consolidation.

We expect Intel to maintain its dominant position in the microprocessor market and to continue to invest heavily in research and development, new manufacturing facilities and other technology companies. Intel has substantially greater financial resources than we do and accordingly spends substantially greater amounts on research and development and production capacity than we do. We expect competition from Intel to continue and increase in the future to the extent Intel reduces the prices for its products and as Intel introduces new competitive products. For example, in 2004, Intel introduced a 64-bit processor for servers and workstations that runs existing 32-bit software applications. These processors compete with our AMD Opteron microprocessors. In addition, Intel recently announced that it will offer dual-core 64-bit processors for the desktop market in the second quarter of 2005. Moreover, Intel currently manufactures certain of its microprocessor products on 300-millimeter wafers using 90-nanometer process technology, which can result in products that are higher performing, use less power and cost less to manufacture. We are currently transitioning to 90-nanometer process technology for microprocessor manufacturing, and we expect to transition to using 300-millimeter wafers in 2006.

Our research and development expenses for fiscal 2004, 2003, and 2002 were $935 million, $852 million and $816 million.
research and development
We conduct product and system research and development activities for our microprocessor products in the United States with additional design and development engineering teams located in Germany, China, Japan and India. With respect to process development, some research and development takes place at Fab 30. We also have a joint development agreement with IBM pursuant to which we work together to develop new microprocessor process technologies to be implemented on silicon wafers. On September 15, 2004, we amended our joint development agreement and extended the relationship for an additional three years, from December 31, 2005 to December 31, 2008. Under the amended development agreement, we agreed to continue to develop jointly new microprocessor process technologies. In addition, we received a license from IBM to have our products made in 90-nanometer and 65-nanometer at a third-party foundry or a joint manufacturing facility owned by us and a third-party foundry. The development agreement may be extended further by the mutual agreement of the parties, and can also be terminated immediately by either party if the other party permanently ceases doing business, becomes bankrupt or insolvent, liquidates or undergoes a change of control, or can be terminated by either party upon 30 days written notice upon a failure of the other party to perform a material obligation thereunder.

development cost
Computation Products operating income of $303 million in 2004 increased by $326 million compared to an operating loss of $23 million in 2003. The increase was primarily due to a 29 percent increase in net sales, partially offset by a 12 percent increase in operating expenses. Operating expenses increased due primarily to an increase in marketing and cooperative advertising costs of $79 million in connection with our AMD64-based products, a nine percent increase in unit shipments, and a $28 million increase in research and development costs. The increase in research and development costs was due primarily to a $29 million increase in Fab 36 start-up costs and a $24 million increase in silicon design related to future generations of our microprocessors offset by a $23 million decrease in Fab 30 research and development activities.

We amortize capital grants and allowances, interest subsidies and research and development subsidies that we receive from the State of Saxony and the Federal Republic of Germany for Fab 30 as they are earned. The amortization of these grants and subsidies is recognized as a credit to research and development expenses and cost of sales. The credit to cost of sales totaled $67.1 million in 2004, $46.2 million in 2003 and $37.5 million in 2002.
development cost
Research and development expenses of $935 million in 2004 increased ten percent from $852 million in 2003 due in part to higher research and development expenses as result of the consolidation of Spansions results of operation, an increase in start-up costs of approximately $29 million associated with the Fab 36 project and a $24 million increase in silicon design related to future generations of our microprocessors. These factors were partially offset by a $23 million decrease in Fab 30 research and development activities. Research and development expenses of $852 million in 2003 increased four percent from $816 million in 2002, due in part to higher research and development expenses as a result of the consolidation of Spansions results of operation, $23 million in research and development efforts related to new microprocessors, and $58 million paid to IBM to jointly develop new process technologies for use in future microprocessor products. The increases in research and development expenses were offset by a $35 million reduction in research and development costs, primarily due to the reduction of research and development activities associated with our PCS products and the absence of the $42 million charge representing amounts paid to IBM in 2002 in exchange for consulting services relating to optimizing the performance of our manufacturing processes.

Of these amounts, AMD Saxony received approximately $411 million in capital investment grants and allowances and $153 million in interest subsidies through December 26, 2004. AMD Saxony also received $58 million in research and development subsidies through December 26, 2004. Amounts received under the Subsidy Agreement are recorded as a long-term liability on our financial statements and are amortized to operations ratably over the contractual life of the Subsidy Agreement as a reduction to operating expenses. As of December 26, 2004, these amounts were being amortized ratably through December 2007. AMD Saxony has received substantially all investment grants and allowances and interest subsidies to which it is entitled. Noncompliance with the conditions of the grants, allowances and subsidies contained in the Subsidy Agreement could result in the forfeiture of all or a portion of the future amounts to be received, as well as the repayment of all or a portion of amounts received to date.

In fiscal 2005, we expect capital expenditures of approximately $1.5 billion. We expect depreciation and amortization expense to be approximately $1.2 billion, and research and development expenses, both in total dollars and as a percentage of sales, to increase primarily due to Fab 36 start-up costs of approximately $200 million. We also expect total marketing, general and administrative expenses to increase in 2005, but to decline as a percentage of sales.

For example, we have a joint development agreement with IBM, pursuant to which we work together to develop new process technologies. In September 2004, we amended this agreement and extended its termination date from December 2005 to December 2008. Under this amended agreement, we anticipate that from December 26, 2004 through December 2008, we would pay fees to IBM of between approximately $220 million and $250 million in connection with joint development projects. In addition, from the beginning of 2002 through December 26, 2004, we paid approximately $247 million to IBM in connection with agreements and services related to license grants and research and development activities.

If this agreement were to be terminated, we would either have to resume research and development activities for microprocessors internally or find an alternative partner. In either case, our research and development costs could increase, and we could experience delays or other setbacks in the development of new process technologies, any of which could materially adversely affect us. Moreover, the successful and timely development and implementation of silicon-on-insulator technology and the achievement of other milestones set forth in the joint development agreement are critical to our AMD64-based processors and to our ability to commence operations at Fab 36 in accordance with our planned schedule.

The Company also contributed its Flash memory inventory, its manufacturing facility located in Austin, Texas (Fab 25), its Flash memory research and development facility in Sunnyvale, California, and its Flash memory assembly and test facilities in Thailand, Malaysia and Suzhou, China to Spansion LLC. The Company recorded its continuing 60 percent interest in these net assets at their historical carrying values. The remaining 40 percent interest in these net assets was treated as being sold to Fujitsu and, accordingly, 40 percent of the carrying values of these net assets were adjusted to and recorded based on the net assets fair value on the effective date of the transaction. During the fourth quarter of 2003, the Company completed its determination of the fair value of the assets and liabilities of Spansion LLC. The excess of the fair value of the net assets treated as sold over their historical carrying value was approximately $57 million. However, the gain of approximately six million dollars recognized by the Company and recorded in interest income and other, net, was limited to the excess of the fair value of the consideration received by the Company in the form of the Companys 60 percent equity interest in Fujitsus contributions and the incremental 10.008 percent interest in the former Manufacturing Joint Ventures net assets less direct costs of the transaction, over the 40 percent interest in the book value of the net assets contributed by the Company to Spansion LLC.

As part of the transaction, the Company and Fujitsu entered into various service contracts with Spansion LLC. The Company will continue to provide, among other things, certain information technology, facilities, logistics, legal, tax, finance, human resources, and environmental health and safety services to Spansion LLC. Under these contracts, Fujitsu will provide, among other things, certain information technology, research and development, quality assurance, insurance, facilities, environmental, and human resources services primarily to Spansion LLCs manufacturing facilities in Japan. Fees earned by the Company and incurred by Spansion LLC for these services are eliminated in consolidation.

The intangible assets recorded consist of the estimated fair value of the manufacturing and product distribution contracts between Spansion LLC and the Company and Spansion LLC and Fujitsu, which are determined to have an estimated useful life of four years, as well as the estimated fair value of the assembled work force, which is reflected as goodwill. No value was assigned to in-process research and development because the Company and Fujitsu performed all research and development activities for the Manufacturing Joint Venture, and the Company and Fujitsu did not convey in-process technology rights to Spansion LLC. Additionally, Spansion LLC pays intellectual property royalties to the Company and Fujitsu for technological know-how used in its business operations at royalty rates deemed to approximate fair market values. No additional intangible assets were identified in connection with the transaction.

The 2002 Restructuring Plan resulted in the consolidation of facilities, primarily at the Companys Sunnyvale, California site and at sales offices worldwide. The Company vacated, and is attempting to sublease, certain facilities currently occupied under long-term operating leases through 2011. The Company also terminated the implementation of certain partially completed enterprise resource planning (ERP) software and other information technology implementation activities, resulting in the abandonment of certain software, hardware and capitalized development costs.

In addition, in order to respond more quickly to changes in market trends in the Flash memory market and improve efficiencies in the production, marketing and design of our Flash memory products, we and Fujitsu Limited formed a new entity named FASL LLC, effective June 30, 2003. We own 60 percent of FASL LLC while Fujitsu owns 40 percent. Accordingly, as of June 30, 2003, we began consolidating the results of FASL LLCs operations. FASL LLC is headquartered in Sunnyvale, California, and its manufacturing, research, test, and assembly operations are in the United States and Asia. FASL LLC engages in the research, development, manufacture, marketing, and promotion of Flash memory products, which it markets under the Spansion global product brand name. We and Fujitsu are the distributors of FASL LLCs Spansion Flash memory products. As part of this transaction, we contributed to FASL LLC our Flash memory inventory, our manufacturing facility located in Austin, Texas, known as Fab 25, our Flash memory research and development facility in Sunnyvale, California, known as the Submicron Development Center, or SDC, and our Flash memory assembly and test operations in Thailand, Malaysia and China. Fujitsu contributed its Flash memory division, including related inventory, cash, and its Flash memory assembly and test operations in Malaysia. In addition, both we and Fujitsu contributed our respective investments in our previous manufacturing joint venture, Fujitsu AMD Semiconductor Limited, located in Aizu-Wakamatsu, Japan, which became part of a wholly owned subsidiary of FASL LLC named FASL JAPAN LIMITED, or FASL JAPAN. In this report we refer to the previous manufacturing joint venture with Fujitsu as the Manufacturing Joint Venture.

In December 2002, we executed an agreement with IBM to jointly develop new logic process technologies, particularly 65- and 45-nanometer technologies to be implemented on 300-millimeter silicon wafers, for use in producing future high-performance microprocessor products. The joint development agreement terminates on December 31, 2005 and may be extended by the mutual agreement of the parties. The agreement can also be terminated immediately by either party if the other party permanently ceases doing business, becomes bankrupt or insolvent, liquidates or undergoes a change of control, or terminated upon 30 days written notice upon a failure to perform a material obligation thereunder. The new process technologies are being developed at an IBM facility in New York and are aimed at improving microprocessor performance and reducing power consumption. The new process technologies will be based on advanced structures and materials such as high-speed SOI transistors, copper interconnects and improved low-k dielectric insulation. During 2002 and 2003, we paid approximately $190 million to IBM in connection with agreements and services related to research and development activities. In addition, in December 2003, we entered into license and consulting services agreements with IBM pursuant to which we licensed technology and know-how developed by IBM in connection with manufacturing products on 300-millimeter silicon wafers. In addition, some development work for logic process technologies took place at Fab 30. Research and development with respect to non-volatile memory technology used for manufacturing Spansion Flash memory products is conducted primarily at FASL LLCs SDC facility located in Sunnyvale, California and at its facilities in Japan. Currently, FASL LLC is developing new non-volatile memory process technology, including 90-nanometer floating gate technology and 90-nanometer MirrorBit technology utilizing three-layer copper interconnect.

Our expenses for research and development were $852 million in 2003, $816 million in 2002, and $651 million in 2001. These expenses represented 24 percent of consolidated net sales in 2003, 30 percent of consolidated net sales in 2002, and 17 percent of consolidated net sales in 2001.

We expect Intel to maintain its dominant position in the microprocessor market and to continue to invest heavily in research and development, new manufacturing facilities and other technology companies. Intel has substantially greater financial resources than we do and accordingly spends substantially greater amounts on research and development than we do. We expect competition from Intel to increase in 2004 and beyond to the extent Intel reduces the prices for its products and as Intel introduces new products. For example, in February 2004, Intel announced that it intends to introduce 64-bit processors for servers and workstations that will be able to run existing 32-bit software applications in mid-2004. We believe that these processors will compete with our AMD Opteron microprocessors. In addition, Intel announced that it will offer 64-bit processors for the desktop market and other market segments that will be able to run existing 32-bit software applications in a time frame based on both timing and availability of the infrastructure required to support them, and customer demand. These products would compete with our AMD Athlon 64 microprocessors. Moreover, Intel currently manufactures certain of its microprocessor products on 300-millimeter wafers using 90-nanometer process technology. Use of 90-nanometer technology can result in products that are higher performing, use less power and that cost less to manufacture. Use of 300-millimeter wafers can decrease manufacturing costs and increase capacity by yielding more equivalent chips per wafer than 200-millimeter wafers. We have not yet made comparable transitions at our microprocessor manufacturing facilities. As a result, we may be more vulnerable to Intels aggressive pricing strategies for microprocessor products. Intels strong position in the microprocessor market, its existing relationships with top-tier OEMs and its aggressive pricing strategies could result in lower unit sales and average selling prices for our products, which could adversely affect our revenues.

Research and development expenses of $852 million in 2003 increased four percent from $816 million in 2002 due primarily to an increase in expenses as a result of the FASL LLC transaction, $23 million in research and development efforts related to new microprocessors, and $58 million in expenses related to amounts paid to IBM to jointly develop new logic process technologies for use in future high-performance microprocessor products. These increases were offset by a $35 million reduction in internal research and development costs from 2002 to 2003, primarily due to the reduction of research and development activities associated with our PCS products and the absence of the $42 million charge representing amounts paid to IBM in 2002 in exchange for consulting services relating to optimizing the performance of our manufacturing processes.

In January 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (FIN 46). Variable interest entities are often created for a single specified purpose, for example, to facilitate securitization, leasing, hedging, research and development, or other transactions or arrangements. In December 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46 (revised December 2003) (FIN 46R) which replaces FIN 46. This interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51, Consolidated Financial Statements, defines what these variable interest entities are and provides guidelines on identifying them and assessing an enterprises interests in a variable interest entity to decide whether to consolidate that entity. FIN 46R applies at different dates to different types of enterprises and entities, and special provisions apply to enterprises that have fully or partially applied FIN 46 prior to issuance of FIN 46R. Generally, application of FIN 46R is required in financial statements of public entities that have interests in variable interest entities or potential variable interest entities commonly referred to as special-purpose entities for periods ending after December 15, 2003. Application by public entities for all other types of entities is required in financial statements for periods ending after March 15, 2004. The adoption of FIN 46 or FIN 46R did not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition.

The Company receives investment grants and allowances as well as interest subsidies under a Subsidy Agreement with the Federal Republic of Germany and the State of Saxony in connection with the construction and facilitization of Fab 30 in Dresden, Germany. Generally, such grants and subsidies are subject to forfeiture in declining amounts over the life of the agreement, if the Company does not maintain certain levels of employment or meet other agreement conditions. Accordingly, amounts received under the Subsidy Agreement are recorded as a long-term liability on the Companys financial statements and are being amortized to operations ratably over the contractual life of the Subsidy Agreement as a reduction to operating expenses through December of 2008. From time to time, the Company also applies subsidies for certain research and development projects.

The Company also contributed its Flash memory inventory, its manufacturing facility located in Austin, Texas (Fab 25), its Flash memory research and development facility in Sunnyvale, California, and its Flash memory assembly and test operations in Thailand, Malaysia and China to FASL LLC. The Company recorded its continuing 60 percent interest in these net assets at their historical carrying values. The remaining 40 percent interest in these net assets was treated as being sold to Fujitsu and, accordingly, 40 percent of the carrying values of these net assets were adjusted to and recorded based on the net assets fair value on the effective date of the transaction. During the fourth quarter of 2003, the Company completed its determination of the fair value of the assets and liabilities of FASL LLC. The excess of the fair value of the net assets treated as sold over their historical carrying value was approximately $57 million. However, the gain of approximately six million dollars recognized by the Company and recorded in interest income and other, net, was limited to the excess of the fair value of the consideration received by the Company in the form of the Companys 60 percent equity interest in Fujitsus contributions and the incremental 10.008 percent interest in the former Manufacturing Joint Ventures net assets less direct costs of the transaction, over the 40 percent interest in the book value of the net assets contributed by the Company to FASL LLC.

As part of the transaction, the Company and Fujitsu entered into various service contracts with FASL LLC. The Company will continue to provide, among other things, certain information technology, facilities, logistics, legal, tax, finance, human resources, and environmental health and safety services to FASL LLC. Under these contracts, Fujitsu will provide, among other things, certain information technology, research and development, quality assurance, insurance, facilities, environmental, and human resources services primarily to FASL LLCs manufacturing facilities in Japan.

In 2002, we entered into several strategic relationships with industry leading companies. Through these relationships, we intend our manufacturing facilities and processes to remain state-of-the-art, while improving our cost structure. For example, in December 2002, we changed our logic process development strategy and entered into an agreement with IBM to jointly develop new logic process technologies for use in future high-performance microprocessor products. As a result of this agreement, we are ramping down silicon processing associated with logic research and development in our Submicron Development Center (SDC) in Sunnyvale, California and will be moving this work to IBMs facility in East Fishkill, New York. In addition, in June 2002 we entered into a joint venture alliance with Infineon Technologies and Dupont Photomasks to construct and operate an advanced research and development and pilot line photomask facility in Dresden, Germany.

Gross margin percentage decreased to 22 percent in 2002 compared to 33 percent in 2001. This decrease was primarily due to decreased sales of both PC processors and Flash memory devices as a result of lower unit demand and average selling prices, partially offset by cost savings realized from the closure of certain facilities pursuant to the 2001 restructuring plan (discussed below) and the reallocation of certain manufacturing resources to research and development activities for new microprocessor products.

In 2002, the Company also entered into long-term research and development agreements. As of December 29, 2002, the Company had recorded a liability and capitalized $90 million in connection with the agreements. This amount is being amortized ratably over the estimated useful lives of the agreements through December 2007.

Of these amounts, AMD Saxony had received approximately $284 million in capital investment grants and allowances and $98 million in interest subsidies. In addition, AMD Saxony received advanced payments for interest subsidies amounting to $49 million, of which approximately $18 million is restricted from the Companys access for more than one year, and is therefore included in Other Assets. In addition to the above-mentioned subsidies, AMD Saxony had also received $31 million in research and development subsidies through December 29, 2002. Amounts received under the Subsidy Agreement are recorded as a long-term liability on the Companys financial statements and are being amortized to operations ratably over the contractual life of the Subsidy Agreement as a reduction to operating expenses through December 2008. The historical rates were used to translate the amounts denominated in deutsche marks (converted to euros) into U.S. dollars.

In December 2002, the Company finalized a restructuring plan (the 2002 Plan) to align its cost structure to current industry conditions resulting from weak customer demand and industry wide excess inventory. The 2002 Plan will result in the reduction of approximately 2,000 positions or 15% of the Companys employees, affecting all levels of its workforce in almost every organization. As a result of the Companys agreement with IBM to develop future generations of the Companys logic process technology, the Company is ramping down its silicon processing associated with logic research and development in its Submicron Development Center in Sunnyvale, California (SDC) and will eliminate most of those related resources, including the sale or abandonment of certain equipment used in the Companys SDC.
development cost
The 2002 Plan will also result in the consolidation of facilities, primarily at the Companys Sunnyvale, California site and at sales offices worldwide. The Company is vacating, and attempting to sublease, certain facilities currently occupied under long-term operating leases. The Company has also terminated the implementation of certain partially completed enterprise resource planning (ERP) software and other information technology implementation activities, resulting in the abandonment of certain software, hardware and capitalized development costs.

The Company accounted for the acquisition using the purchase method and the assets and operations acquired were combined with the Companys Core Products segment. Approximately $2.9 million of the purchase price represented acquired in-process research and development that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use. The $2.9 million was expensed upon the acquisition of Alchemy. In addition, the Company recorded $18.7 million of goodwill, which is not being amortized, based on the residual difference between the amount paid and the fair values assigned to identified tangible and intangible assets using an independent valuation.

In order to remain competitive, we must continue to make substantial investments in the improvement of our process technologies. In particular, we have made and continue to make significant research and development investments in the technologies and equipment used to fabricate our microprocessor products and our Flash memory devices. Portions of these investments might not be fully recovered if we fail to continue to gain market acceptance or if the market for our microprocessor or Flash memory products should significantly deteriorate. In addition, if we are unable to remain competitive with respect to process technology, we will be materially and adversely affected.

Intel has dominated the market for microprocessors used in PCs for many years. Because of its dominant market position, Intel has historically set and controlled x86 microprocessor and PC system standards and, thus, dictated the type of product the market requires of Intel's competitors. In addition, Intel may and does vary prices on its microprocessors and other products at will and thereby affects the margins and profitability of its competitors due to its financial strength and dominant position. Intel also exerts substantial influence over PC manufacturers and their channels of distribution through the "Intel Inside" brand and other marketing programs. Intel invests billions of dollars in, and as a result exerts influence over, many other technology companies. We expect Intel to continue to invest heavily in research and development, new manufacturing facilities and other technology companies, and to remain dominant:

The result was the reversal of expenses recorded to write off such IPR&D in the acquisition periods. The reduction in the allocations of the IPR&D assets resulted in an increase in goodwill. Although the effect of the expense reversal did not impact pre-tax income for the periods being presented since the related acquisitions occurred prior to 2000, the increase to goodwill resulted in increased amortization expense for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000.

IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AND OTHER CHARGES. In 1998, we recorded a pre-tax charge of $196 million in connection with the Brooks Fiber Properties merger, the MCI merger and asset write-downs and loss contingencies. Brooks Fiber Properties is a leading facilities-based provider of competitive local telecommunications services. This charge included $21 million for employee severance, $17 million for Brooks Fiber Properties direct merger costs, $38 million for conformance of Brooks Fiber Properties accounting policies, $56 million for exit costs under long-term commitments, $31 million for write-down of a permanently impaired investment and $33 million related to asset write-downs and loss contingencies. The $56 million related to long-term commitments includes $33 million of minimum commitments between 1999 and 2008 for leased facilities that we have or will abandon, $19 million related to minimum contractual network lease commitments that expire between 1999 and 2001, for which we will receive no future benefit due to the migration of traffic to owned facilities, and $4 million of other commitments. Because of organizational and operational changes that occurred, management concluded in 1999 that selected leased properties would not be abandoned according to the original plan that was approved by management. Therefore, in 1999 a reversal of a $9 million charge to in-process research and development and other charges was recorded in connection with this plan amendment. Additionally, the $33 million related to asset write-downs and loss contingencies includes $9 million for the decommission of information systems that have no alternative future use, $9 million for the write-down to fair value of assets held for sale that were disposed of in 1998 and $15 million related to legal costs and other items related to Brooks Fiber Properties.
research and development
In connection with 1998 business combinations, we made allocations of the purchase price to acquired in-process research and development totaling $429 million in the first quarter of 1998 related to the CompuServe merger and ANS transaction and $3.1 billion in the third quarter of 1998 related to the MCI merger. These allocations represent the estimated fair value based on risk-adjusted future cash flows related to the incomplete projects. At the date of the respective business combinations, the development of these projects had not yet reached technological feasibility and the research and development in progress had no alternative future uses. Accordingly, these costs were expensed as of the respective acquisition dates.

IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AND OTHER CHARGES. In 1998, the WorldCom group recorded a pre-tax charge of $177 million in connection with the Brooks Fiber Properties merger, the MCI merger and asset write-downs and loss contingencies. This charge included $21 million for employee severance, $17 million for Brooks Fiber Properties direct merger costs, $38 million for conformance of Brooks Fiber Properties accounting policies, $37 million for exit costs under long-term commitments, $31 million for the write-down of a permanently impaired investment and $33 million related to asset write-downs and loss contingencies. The $37 million related to long-term commitments includes $33 million of minimum commitments between 1999 and 2008 for leased facilities that the WorldCom group has or will abandon, and $4 million of other commitments. Because of organizational and operational changes that occurred, management concluded in 1999 that selected leased properties would not be abandoned according to the original plan that was approved by management. Therefore, in 1999 a reversal of a $9 million charge to in-process research and development and other charges was recorded in connection with this plan amendment. Additionally, the $33 million related to asset write-downs and loss contingencies includes $9 million for the decommission of information systems that have no alternative future use, $9 million for the write-down to fair value of assets held for sale that were disposed of in 1998 and $15 million related to legal costs and other items related to Brooks Fiber Properties.
research and development
In connection with 1998 business combinations, WorldCom made allocations of the purchase price to acquired in-process research and development totaling $429 million in the first quarter of 1998 related to the CompuServe merger and ANS transaction and $3.1 billion in the third quarter of 1998 related to the MCI merger. These allocations represent the then estimated fair value based on risk-adjusted future cash flows related to the incomplete projects. At the date of the respective business combinations, the development of these projects had not yet reached technological feasibility and the research and development in progress had no alternative future uses. Accordingly, these costs were expensed as of the respective acquisition dates.
research and development
Based on the respective fair values of the related operations allocated to each group, $2.3 billion of the in-process research and development charge was allocated to the WorldCom group. Management believes that this method of allocation provides a reasonable estimate of the in-process research and development charges attributable to each group.

The purchase price in the MCI Merger was allocated based on estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. This resulted in an excess of purchase price over net assets acquired of which $3.1 billion was allocated to in-process research and development ("IPR&D") and $1.7 billion to developed technology, which will be depreciated over 10 years on a straight-line basis. The remaining excess of $29.3 billion has been allocated to goodwill and tradename, which are being amortized over 40 years on a straight-line basis.

This charge included $21 million for employee severance, $17 million for Brooks Fiber Properties direct merger costs, $38 million for conformance of Brooks Fiber Properties accounting policies, $37 million for exit costs under long-term commitments, $31 million for the write-down of a permanently impaired investment and $33 million related to asset

write-downs and loss contingencies. The $37 million related to long-term commitments includes $33 million of minimum commitments between 1999 and 2008 for leased facilities that the WorldCom group has or will abandon, and $4 million of other commitments. Because of organizational and operational changes that occurred, management concluded in 1999 that selected leased properties would not be abandoned according to the original plan that was approved by management. Therefore, in 1999 a reversal of a $9 million charge to in-process research and development and other charges was recorded in connection with this plan amendment. Additionally, the $33 million related to asset write- downs and loss contingencies includes $9 million for the decommission of information systems that have no alternative future use, $9 million for the write-down to fair value of assets held for sale that were disposed of in 1998 and $15 million related to legal costs and other items related to Brooks Fiber Properties.

In connection with 1998 business combinations, WorldCom made allocations of the purchase price to acquired in-process research and development totaling $429 million in the first quarter of 1998 related to the CompuServe merger and ANS transaction and $3.1 billion in the third quarter of 1998 related to the MCI merger. These allocations represent the then estimated fair value based on risk-adjusted future cash flows related to the incomplete projects. At the date of the respective business combinations, the development of these projects had not yet reached technological feasibility and the research and development in progress had no alternative future uses. Accordingly, these costs were expensed as of the respective acquisition dates.

Based on the respective fair values of the related operations allocated to each group, $2.3 billion of the in-process research and development charge was allocated to the WorldCom group. Management believes that this method of allocation provides a reasonable estimate of the in-process research and development charges attributable to each group.

PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES. The effective income tax rate for 2000 was 40.0% of income before taxes versus 41.4% in 1999. The rates are greater than the expected federal statutory rate of 35% primarily due to the amortization of the non-deductible goodwill. Excluding non-deductible amortization of goodwill, our effective income tax rate would have been 35.0% in 2000, and 36.2% in 1999. In 1998, we recorded a tax provision of $877 million on a pretax loss of $1.6 billion. Although we generated a consolidated pretax loss for 1998, permanent non-deductible items aggregating approximately $4.0 billion, including the in-process research and development charges discussed above, resulted in the recognition of taxable income.

In 1998, the Company recorded a pre-tax charge of $196 million in connection with the BFP Merger, the MCI Merger and asset write-downs and loss contingencies. This charge included $21 million for employee severance, $17 million for BFP direct merger costs, $38 million for conformance of BFP accounting policies, $56 million for exit costs under long-term commitments, $31 million for write-down of a permanently impaired investment and $33 million related to asset write-downs and loss contingencies. The $56 million related to long-term commitments includes $33 million of minimum commitments between 1999 and 2008 for leased facilities that the Company has or will abandon, $19 million related to minimum contractual network lease commitments that expire between 1999 and 2001, for which the Company will receive no future benefit due to the migration of traffic to owned facilities, and $4 million of other commitments. Because of organizational and operational changes that occurred, management concluded in 1999 that selected leased properties would not be abandoned according to the original plan that was approved by management. Therefore, in 1999 a reversal of a $9 million charge to IPR&D and other charges was recorded in connection with this plan amendment. Additionally, the $33 million related to asset write-downs and loss contingencies includes $9 million for the decommission of information systems that have no alternative future use, $9 million for the write-down to fair value of assets held for sale that were disposed of in 1998 and $15 million related to legal costs and other items related to BFP. As of December 31, 1999 and 2000, the Company's remaining unpaid liability related to the above charges was $27 million and $20 million, respectively.

We expended approximately $4,948,000 and $2,719,000 in both internally and externally funded research and development (“R&D”) costs for potential new products and enhancements during the years ended January 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.

r&d
We continued various development efforts during fiscal year 2013 for both military and commercial applications. Creating innovative digital, integrated standby devices has been a primary focus of our R&D efforts, along with additional advancements for our industry unique air data instruments. These efforts will provide for an integrated product line from sensors and information processing through primary and backup displays for the flight crew. Further, we plan to continue our design efforts to satisfy our existing contractual obligations as well as our internal development of products for future customer applications. This includes re-engineering of existing products and processes to improve manufacturability, increase reliability, enhance throughput, and reduce production costs.
research and development
Our customers continually seek improvements in the products that we manufacture and market. As a result, in order to meet our customers’ needs, we must continue to develop new products and innovations and enhancements to existing products. Many of our competitors have significantly more capital than we have and as a result have the ability to devote more resources to research and development and to marketing of their products. In order to remain competitive, we must continue to devote a material portion of our financial resources to research and development and there is no assurance that we will be successful in our product improvement efforts in our competitive marketplace.
research and development
Our need to expend resources on research and development to provide our customer base with new and enhanced products as well as to continuously upgrade our process technology and manufacturing capabilities requires us to invest necessary resources on an annual basis. If we elect to expand our operations in future periods, whether as a result of organic growth or through strategic acquisitions, our capital needs would increase. Our ability to raise capital to meet our existing and future needs may depend on a variety of factors, some of which will not be within our control, including investor perceptions of us, our businesses and the industries in which we operate, and general economic conditions. We may be unable to successfully raise additional capital, if needed. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash from operations or raise additional capital in the future, we may have to limit our growth, enter into less favorable financing arrangements, or scale back on planned research and development or upgrades, any of which could have a materially adverse effect on our profitability.

The trend in the aerospace industry continues toward digital cockpits and away from mechanical cockpit instrumentation that was our foundation. During fiscal year 2013, we continued to make progress in our ability to design and manufacture digital instrumentation that is integrated into cockpit flight management systems. We maintained and strengthened our commitment to research and development to further enhance our product line as we anticipate continued movement toward digital cockpits in the aerospace industry. Our new OASIS® multi-function standby display is being promoted in support of this trend. We plan to position ourselves such that we continue to offer both digital and mechanical instrumentation solutions to our customers. While we believe that this strategy will, over time, strengthen our position in the aerospace industry, we cannot guarantee that this strategy will be successful or that we will have access to the capital resources needed to fully support this strategy.

In August 2011, the Budget Control Act reduced the U.S. DoD top line budget by approximately $490 billion through 2021. In addition, U.S. government expenditures are subject to the potential for further reductions, generally referred to as "sequestration". Sequestration would result in additional reductions of approximately $500 billion from the defense top line budget through 2021. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has estimated that sequestration would reduce non-exempt defense discretionary accounts during U.S. government fiscal year 2013 by approximately 9.4% (excluding military personnel accounts). The OMB has further stated that the budget for Overseas Contingency Operations and any unobligated balances in prior year funds would be included in aggregate reductions but has otherwise indicated that it cannot yet assess the impact of sequestration at the program, project and activity level. The U.S. DoD has indicated that such reductions might require the termination of certain, as yet undetermined, procurement programs, and other U.S. government customers, such as NASA and various intelligence agencies, may be required to take comparable actions. Any such impacts could have a material effect on our results of operations, financial position and/or cash flows. With the aforementioned fiscal challenges as a backdrop, the U.S. DoD announced a significant revision to the defense strategy in January 2012. This new strategy prioritized the Asia Pacific and Middle East regions, reduced the number of ground forces, maintained nuclear deterrence and reduced Cold War assets. Additionally, it emphasized the increasing importance of Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C4ISR); Cyber Security; Space; Special Operations; and Unmanned Systems in implementing the nation's security posture. We have been developing organic capabilities to better serve our customers and their emerging needs in these markets, including the continued R&D efforts on both our flush port and legacy probe air data technologies.

Our senior management regularly reviews the performance of our operations including reviews of key performance metrics and the status of operating initiatives. We review information on the financial performance of the operations, new business opportunities, customer relationships and initiatives, independent research and development (IR&D) activities, human resources, manufacturing effectiveness, cost reduction activities, as well as other subjects. We compare performance against budget, against prior comparable periods and against our most recent internal forecasts. We do not expect the impact of inflation and changing prices on net sales and income from continuing operations to be material.

Selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A) for fiscal year 2013 were $10,152,000, an increase of $2,998,000 compared to $7,154,000 in fiscal year 2012. The net increase was driven primarily by $2.4 million of increased independent research and development costs, most significantly relating to the OASIS® product. In addition, we incurred increased compensation costs and outside services costs, which were partially offset by lower business development costs.

Income tax expense was $920,000 in fiscal year 2013 compared to income tax expense of $436,000 in fiscal year 2012. The effective tax rate of 26.6% in fiscal year 2013 was lower than the effective tax rate of 52.7% in fiscal year 2012 due primarily to the fiscal year 2013 benefit of a research and development tax credit as well as fiscal year 2012 permanent differences. See Note 11 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements”.

Our liquidity will depend on our ability to continue to achieve improved operating results and contain costs related to the development of new products. Sufficient liquidity is necessary to, among other things, (i) satisfy working capital requirements, (ii) fulfill necessary capital spending, and (iii) meet our debt obligations in fiscal year 2014 and beyond. A fiscal year 2013 cash advances from a customer, presented as deferred revenue of $1,669,000 as of January 31, 2013, improved our cash flow from operations as presented on our statement of cash flows for the year ended January 31, 2013. Our failure to improve our operating results could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and could require the implementation of curative measures, including raising capital, deferring planned capital expenditures and research and development efforts, reductions in force, reducing discretionary spending, and selling assets. There can be no assurance that our proposed plans and actions will be successful or that unforeseen circumstances will not require us to seek additional funding sources in the future or effectuate additional plans to conserve liquidity. In addition, there can be no assurance that in the event additional sources of funds are needed, they will be available on acceptable terms, if at all.
research and development
Our future capital requirements depend on numerous factors, including research and development, expansion of product lines and other factors. Furthermore, we may need to develop and introduce new or enhanced products, respond to competitive pressures, invest or acquire businesses or technologies or respond to unanticipated requirements or developments, which would require additional resources. Currently, our cash flow from operations alone may not be sufficient to meet these challenges.

Periodically, the Company enters into research and development contracts with customers. When the contracts provide for milestone or other interim payments, the Company will recognize revenue either under the Milestone method or the Multiple-Elements Arrangement method. The Milestone method requires the Company to deem all milestone payments within each contract as either substantive or non-substantive. That conclusion is determined based upon a thorough review of each contract and the Company’s deliverables committed to in each contract. For substantive milestones, the Company concludes that upon achievement of each milestone, the amount of the corresponding defined payment is commensurate with the effort required to achieve such milestone or the value of the delivered item. The payment associated with each milestone relates solely to past performance and is deemed reasonable upon consideration of the deliverables and the payment terms within the contract. For non-substantive milestones, including advance payments, the recognition of such payments are pro-rated to the substantive milestones. Milestones may include, for example, the successful completion of design review or technical review, the submission and acceptance of technical drawings, delivery of hardware, software, spares, test equipment or regulatory agency certifications.

The carrying value of goodwill is reviewed at least annually for impairment and will be reviewed more frequently if current events and circumstances indicate a possible impairment. An impairment loss is charged to expense in the period identified. As current events and circumstances warrant, the Company examines the carrying value of its intangible assets with finite lives, such as capitalized software and development costs, purchased intangibles, and other long-lived assets, to determine whether there are any impairment losses. If indicators of impairment are present and future cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover the asset’s carrying amount, an impairment loss is charged to expense in the period identified. Factors that may cause impairment include negative industry or economic trends or significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results.

We continued various development efforts during fiscal year 2012 for both military and commercial applications. Creating innovative digital, integrated standby devices has been a primary focus of our R&D efforts, along with additional advancements for our industry unique air data instruments. These efforts will provide for an integrated product line from sensors and information processing through primary and backup displays for the flight crew. Further, we plan to continue our design efforts to satisfy our existing contractual obligations as well as our internal development of products for future customer applications. This includes re-engineering of existing products and processes to improve manufacturability, increase reliability, enhance throughput, and reduce production costs.

Our customers continually seek improvements in the products that we manufacture and market. As a result, in order to meet our customers’ needs, we must continue to develop new products and innovations and enhancements to existing products. Many of our competitors have significantly more capital than we have and as a result have the ability to devote more resources to research and development and to marketing of their products. In order to remain competitive, we must continue to devote a material portion of our financial resources to research and development and there is no assurance that we will be successful in our product improvement efforts in our competitive marketplace.

Our need to expend resources on research and development to provide our customer base with new and enhanced products as well as to continuously upgrade our process technology and manufacturing capabilities requires us to invest necessary resources on an annual basis. If we elect to expand our operations in future periods, whether as a result of organic growth or through strategic acquisitions, our capital needs would increase. Our ability to raise capital to meet our existing and future needs may depend on a variety of factors, some of which will not be within our control, including investor perceptions of us, our businesses and the industries in which we operate, and general economic conditions. We may be unable to successfully raise additional capital, if needed. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash from operations or raise additional capital in the future, we may have to limit our growth, enter into less favorable financing arrangements, or scale back on planned research and development or upgrades, any of which could have a materially adverse effect on our profitability.

Our liquidity will depend on our ability to achieve budgeted operating results and to refinance or renew our Revolving Credit Line Note when it matures on June 27, 2012. Sufficient liquidity is necessary to, among other things, (i) satisfy working capital requirements, (ii) fulfill necessary capital spending, and (iii) meet our debt obligations in fiscal year 2013 and beyond. Although our fiscal year 2012 cash flows from operations improved over the prior year, we continue to experience liquidity challenges because of our reduced earnings, increased demand for capital additions and debt repayment during fiscal year 2012 when compared to fiscal year 2011. Our failure to improve our operating results could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and could require the implementation of curative measures, including raising capital, deferring planned capital expenditures and research and development efforts, reductions in force, reducing discretionary spending, and selling assets. There can be no assurance that our proposed plans and actions will be successful or that unforeseen circumstances will not require us to seek additional funding sources in the future or effectuate additional plans to conserve liquidity. In addition, there can be no assurance that in the event additional sources of funds are needed, they will be available on acceptable terms, if at all.

Our customers continually seek improvements in the products that we manufacture and market. As a result, in order to meet our customers needs, we must continue to develop new products and innovations and enhancements to existing products. Many of our competitors have significantly more capital than we have and as a result have the ability to devote more resources to research and development and to marketing of their products. In order to remain competitive, we must continue to devote a material portion of our financial resources to research and development and there is no assurance that we will be successful in our product improvement efforts in our competitive marketplace.

Our need to expend resources on research and development to provide our customer base with new and enhanced products as well as to continuously upgrade our process technology and manufacturing capabilities requires us to expend up to 5% annually. If we elect to expand our operations in future periods, whether as a result of organic growth or through strategic acquisitions, our capital needs would increase. Our ability to raise capital to meet our existing and future needs may depend on a variety of factors, some of which will not be within our control, including investor perceptions of us, our businesses and the industries in which we operate, and general economic conditions. We may be unable to successfully raise additional capital, if needed. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash from operations or raise additional capital in the future, we may have to limit our growth, enter into less favorable financing arrangements, or scale back on planned research and development or upgrades, any of which could have a materially adverse effect on our profitability.

In fiscal year 2009, we made progress in acquiring the ability to manufacture digital instrumentation that is integrated into cockpit flight management systems. We have maintained our commitment to research and development to facilitate this upgrade in our product line as we anticipate further movement toward digital cockpits in the aerospace industry. We plan to position ourselves in a market niche where we have the ability to offer both digital and mechanical instrumentation. While we believe that this strategy will, over time, strengthen our position in the aerospace industry, we cannot guarantee that this strategy will be successful or that we will have access to the capital resources needed to fully support this strategy.

The Company expended approximately $758,000, $167,000 and $745,000 in research and development costs for potential new products and enhancements during the fiscal years ended January 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The increase in expenditures in 2005 is due to the establishment of an engineering and product development function in the Clearwater Instruments operations. The reduction in expenditures in 2004 is a result of the redirection of resources toward specific customer contracts where such charges are classified as cost of sales. Approximately 34 engineers working at the Company, on a full-time or part-time basis, are involved in these activities.

The trend in the aviation industry is toward digital cockpits as the industry moves away from mechanical cockpit instrumentation that was the foundation of the Company. The Company has made considerable progress in developing electronic instrumentation that is integrated into cockpit flight management systems to replace mechanical instrumentation that the Company had previously offered to its customers. The Company is currently developing digital-display instrumentation to further replace mechanical instrumentation in its product line to broaden its offering to customers who may want to upgrade their cockpits. The Company has increased its research and development expenditures to facilitate this upgrade in its product line as it anticipates further movement toward digital cockpits in the aviation industry, positioning itself in a market niche where it has the ability to offer both digital and mechanical instrumentation. While the Company believes that this strategy strengthens its position in the industry, it cannot guarantee that this strategy will be successful.

In addition, future capital requirements depend on numerous factors, including research and development, expansion of products lines, and other factors. Management believes that cash and cash equivalents, together with the Companys cash flow from operations and current borrowing arrangements, will provide for these necessary capital expenditures. Furthermore, the Company may develop and introduce new or enhanced products, respond to competitive pressures, invest or acquire businesses or technologies or respond to unanticipated requirements or developments, which would require additional resources.

In order to remain competitive, we must make substantial investments in research and development to develop new and enhanced products and continuously upgrade our process technology and manufacturing capabilities. We may be unable to fund all of these needs or possible acquisitions. Our ability to raise additional capital may depend on a variety of factors, some of which will not be within our control, including investor perceptions of us, our businesses and the industries in which we operate, and general economic conditions.

Research at Avionics Specialties in fiscal 2002 was primarily concerned with the development and qualification of the Integrated Multi Function Probe (IMFP). Discussions with the European JAA certification authorities revealed that they require new and very severe icing tests for all new certifications. The severity of these new requirements has required a substantial effort to evaluate and have also required a change in the IMFP heater design during the past year. Qualification of the IMFP for Military programs, including icing, is nearing completion with the civilian (FAA/JAA) qualification tests to follow. Flight- testing of the military versions on the US F-16 and the Korean T-50 will commence early in FY 2003. A third customer for the military version of the IMFP was added during FY 2002 when it was selected for use on the Aermacchi MB339 trainer aircraft. Early in FY 2003, notification was received that a derivative of the IMFP had been selected for use on the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF). The requirements for JSF probe will require a new design based on the IMFP with development beginning in FY 2003. The completion of the IMFP development and the start of the JSF probe development will be the focus of the majority of the Research and Development activities in the next year.

research and development
Research and development in fiscal year 2001 continued the development of the new Integrated Multi function Probe (IMFP) and Engine and Vibration Monitoring System (EVMS). The EVMS was successfully installed and demonstrated in helicopters in Norway and China culminating with certification approval of the system by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) in the UK and the Norwegian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA). This system will be slightly modified in fiscal year 2002 to expand its capabilities and increase the number and types of aircraft that it is applicable to. The IMFP development was flight tested by Airbus Industries on an A320 at the end of the year. Further commercial flight testing by Cessna and Dornier is scheduled for early this year. The development of this product for the two current military contracts, Korean T-50 and Lockheed F-16 Block 60 and the future possibility of the Joint Strike Fighter will begin qualification and wind tunnel testing early in fiscal year 2002. The development programs and testing for IMFP, and the installation and certification of the EVMS will dominate the research and development efforts in fiscal year 2002.

research and development
iDNA's revenues are significantly concentrated in communications, media and entertainment and iDNA’s clients are concentrated within specific industries including pharmaceuticals, legal and professional services, and financial services. These industries are subject to fluctuations of business communications needs based upon the timing of research and development activities, new product launches, continuing educational support, marketplace communication, general budgetary levels, regulatory changes and general economic trends. Consequently, many of iDNA’s clients will likely be influenced at the same time by similar economic or regulatory factors, which can affect the level of spending for advertising, marketing, promotion and communication services. In the event of a decline, projected decline or delay in such spending, the management of iDNA’s clients may choose to cut back or defer spending for iDNA’s services. It is reasonable to expect that, if one client reduces or delays its spending in response to a major economic factor, other clients will also decide to reduce or delay their spending at approximately the same time. Accordingly, iDNA’s revenues are subject to fluctuations as a result of factors that affect its client’s expenditures.

Delphax maintains a September 30 fiscal year. The returns for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018 have not yet been filed. Included in the deferred tax balances above and related to Delphax and its subsidiaries are estimated foreign and domestic tax loss carryforwards of $13.4 million and $15.2 million, respectively as well as foreign research and development credit carryforwards of $4.5 million, which are available to offset future income tax. The credits and net operating losses expire in varying amounts beginning in the year 2023. The TCJA repealed the corporate alternative minimum tax and made any minimum tax credit carryforwards to the extent not utilized refundable for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017. As a result, Delphax will be able to receive a refund of its minimum tax credit carryforward of $311,000 beginning in their fiscal year ended September 30, 2019. Previously, a valuation allowance was established against the minimum tax credit carryforward. As a result of the TCJA relating to the refundability of the minimum tax credit carryforward, an income tax benefit was recognized by the Company during the prior period and a long-term income tax receivable was established. Should there be an ownership change for purposes of Section 382 or any equivalent foreign tax rules, the utilization of the previously mentioned carryforwards may be significantly limited. Furthermore, Delphax is currently undergoing bankruptcy proceedings with their Canadian entity (see Note 11) and intends to liquidate both the United Kingdom and French entities as well. The Company anticipates those proceedings will be completed within the next fiscal year. Upon completion, any remaining tax attributes, including net operating losses and credit carryforwards in each respective jurisdiction will be lost. The Company has recorded an outside basis difference in the stock of these entities of $6.4 million, which is the estimated loss that will be recognized in the United States upon their liquidation. See additional information regarding Delphax Canada in Note 11.

The objective of this program is to develop new products in our current product lines, improve current products and develop new product lines. The Company expects to continue additional R&D in 2019 in all these fields.
r&d
In many of our markets, we compete with numerous other companies in the sale of healthcare products. These markets are dominated by established manufacturers that have broader product lines, greater distribution capabilities, substantially greater capital resources and larger marketing, R&D staffs and facilities than ours. Many of these competitors offer broader product lines within the specific product market and in the general field of medical devices and supplies. Broad product lines give many of our cardiovascular and fluid delivery competitors the ability to negotiate exclusive, long-term medical device supply contracts and, consequently, the ability to offer comprehensive pricing of their competing products. By offering a broader product line in the general field of medical devices and supplies, competitors may also have a significant advantage in marketing competing products to group purchasing organizations, health maintenance organizations, and other managed care organizations that are increasingly seeking to reduce costs through centralization of purchasing functions. Furthermore, innovations in surgical techniques, product design or functions, or medical practices could have the effect of reducing or eliminating market demand for one or more of our products. In addition, our competitors may use price reductions to preserve market share in their product markets.
r&d
The manufacture and sale of medical products are subject to comprehensive regulation by numerous United States and foreign regulatory agencies, principally the FDA in the United States. The R&D, manufacturing, promotion, marketing and distribution of medical products in the United States are subject to the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and the regulations promulgated thereunder. All manufacturers of medical devices must register with the FDA and list all medical devices manufactured by them. The list must be updated annually. Our medical products subsidiaries and certain of our customers are subject to inspection by the FDA for compliance with such regulations and procedures and our medical products manufacturing facilities are subject to regulation by the FDA. In order for our products to be marketed in countries outside the United States, regulatory approvals must be obtained, and extensive product and quality system regulations must be complied with, in those countries. These regulations, including the requirements for approvals or clearance and the time required for regulatory review, vary significantly from country to country. Some countries have regulatory review processes which are substantially longer than similar processes in the United States. Failure to obtain regulatory approval in a timely manner and to meet all local requirements including language and specific safety standards in any foreign country in which we would like for our products to be marketed could prevent our products from being marketed in those countries.
r&d
Unaffiliated third party suppliers provide a number of goods and services to our manufacturing and R&D organizations. Third party suppliers are required to comply with our quality standards. Failure of a third party supplier to provide compliant raw materials or supplies could result in delays, service interruptions or other quality related issues that may negatively impact our business results.
r&d
In many of our markets, we compete with numerous other companies that have substantially greater financial resources and engage in substantially more R&D activities than we do. Furthermore, innovations in surgical techniques or medical practices could have the effect of reducing or eliminating market demand for one or more of our products. In addition, the trend of consolidation in the medical device industry and among our customers could result in greater competition and pricing pressure.

Our strategy is to provide a broad selection of products in the areas of our expertise. R&D efforts are focused on improving current products and developing highly-engineered products that meet customer needs and serve niche markets with meaningful sales potential. Proposed new products may be subject to regulatory clearance or approval prior to commercialization and the time period for introducing a new product to the marketplace can be unpredictable. We also focus on controlling costs by investing in modern manufacturing technologies and controlling purchasing processes. We have been successful in consistently generating cash from operations and have used that cash to reduce or eliminate indebtedness, to fund capital expenditures, to make investments, to repurchase stock and to pay dividends.

Operating expenses were $30.1 million in 2018, $29.5 million in 2017 and $28.5 in 2016. R&D expenses decreased $286,000 in 2018 as compared with 2017 primarily as a result of decreased costs for outside services and supplies partially offset by increased compensation costs. R&D expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related expenses of our R&D personnel as well as costs associated with regulatory matters. In 2018, selling expenses increased $1.1 million as compared with 2017 primarily as a result of increased commissions, outside services, compensation and travel costs. Selling expenses consist primarily of salaries, commissions and other related expenses for sales and marketing personnel, marketing, advertising and promotional expenses. General and Administrative, or G&A, expenses decreased $213,000 in 2018 as compared to 2017 primarily as a result of decreased compensation and compensation related costs partially offset by increased outside services and increased computer hardware and software costs.
r&d
R&D expenses decreased $775,000 in 2017 as compared with 2016 primarily as a result of decreased costs for outside services and supplies. In 2017, selling expenses increased $640,000 as compared with 2016 primarily as a result of increased commissions, outside services, compensation and travel costs. G&A expenses increased $1.1 million in 2017 as compared to 2016 primarily as a result of increased compensation and compensation related costs and increased outside services partially offset by reduced depreciation, amortization and travel costs.
r&d
Income tax expense in 2018 totaled $7.8 million, compared with $5.7 million in 2017 and $11.7 million in 2016. The effective tax rates for 2018, 2017 and 2016 were 18.5 percent, 13.6 percent and 29.8 percent, respectively. The Tax Act reduced the corporate federal income tax rate in the United States from 35% to 21% effective for us on January 1, 2018. This rate reduction reduced our net deferred tax liability, including adjustments to our net state deferred tax liabilities, by $4.1 million as of December 31, 2017. Based upon this tax law enactment, we recorded a corresponding benefit in our income tax provision of $4.1 million for the fourth quarter and the full year of 2017. Also, in the fourth quarter of 2017 we recorded a valuation allowance of $609,000 to reduce our deferred tax assets which partially offset the benefit recorded in our income tax provision from the tax law change in 2017. We recorded excess tax benefits related to employee stock compensation of $95,000, $5.8 million and $687,000 for the years ended December 31 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Benefits from R&D tax credits totaled $1.2 million in 2018, $1.0 million in 2017 and $1.1 million in 2016. Benefits from tax incentives for domestic production totaled $630,000 in 2017 and $1.2 million in 2016. The Tax Act ended the domestic production activities deduction under Section 199 for 2018. The Tax Act added a new deduction starting in 2018 for foreign-derived intangible income under Section 250 which created a tax benefit for us in 2018 of $1.0 million. Charges from changes in uncertain tax positions totaled $865,000 in 2017. Benefits from changes in uncertain tax positions totaled $373,000 in 2018 and $120,000 in 2016. Charges for state income taxes totaled $1.6 million in 2018, $662,000 in 2017 and $730,000 in 2016. We expect our effective tax rate for 2019 to be approximately 20.0 percent. Accounting for stock based awards could create volatility in our effective tax rate depending upon the extent of exercise or vesting activity.

Some of the markets in which we compete are dominated by established manufacturers that have broader product lines, greater distribution capabilities, substantially larger marketing, R&D staffs and facilities than we do. Many of these competitors offer broader product lines within the specific product market and in the general field of medical devices and supplies. Broad product lines give many of our cardiovascular and fluid delivery competitors the ability to negotiate exclusive, long-term medical device supply contracts and, consequently, the ability to offer comprehensive pricing of their competing products. By offering a broader product line in the general field of medical devices and supplies, competitors may also have a significant advantage in marketing competing products to group purchasing organizations. In addition, our competitors may use price reductions to preserve market share in their product markets.

Our strategy is to provide a broad selection of products in the areas of our expertise. R&D efforts are focused on improving current products and developing highly-engineered products that meet customer needs and serve niche markets with meaningful sales potential. Proposed new products may be subject to regulatory clearance or approval prior to commercialization and the time period for introducing a new product to the marketplace can be unpredictable. We also focus on controlling costs by investing in modern manufacturing technologies and controlling purchasing processes. We have been successful in consistently generating cash from operations and have used that cash to reduce or eliminate indebtedness, to fund capital expenditures, to make investments, to repurchase stock and to pay dividends.

Operating expenses were $28.5 million in both 2016 and 2015 and $27.7 million in 2014. R&D expenses increased $228,000 in 2016 as compared to 2015 primarily as a result of increased costs for supplies and travel partially offset by reduced outside services. R&D expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related expenses of our R&D personnel as well as costs associated with regulatory matters. In 2016, selling expenses increased $568,000 as compared with 2015 primarily as a result of increased travel, outside services, compensation and trade shows. Selling expenses consist primarily of salaries, commissions and other related expenses for sales and marketing personnel, marketing, advertising and promotional expenses. General and administrative, or G&A, expenses decreased $763,000 in 2016 as compared to 2015 primarily as a result of reduced compensation and benefits. G&A expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related expenses of administrative, executive and financial personnel and outside professional fees.

R&D expenses increased $1.1 million in 2015 as compared to 2014 primarily as a result of increased costs for outside services and supplies. In 2015, selling expenses decreased $167,000 as compared with 2014 primarily as a result of decreased promotional costs partially offset by increased commissions. G&A expenses decreased $123,000 in 2015 as compared to 2014 primarily as a result of reduced outside services partially offset by increased amortization.

Income tax expense in 2016 totaled $11.7 million, compared with $11.9 million in 2015 and $14.2 million in 2014. The effective tax rates for 2016, 2015 and 2014 were 29.8 percent, 29.2 percent and 33.8 percent, respectively. The effective tax rate for 2016 benefitted by $687,000 from the early adoption of ASU 2016-09 regarding the accounting for employee share-based compensation. The adoption was on a prospective basis and therefore had no impact on prior years. The effective tax rate for 2015 benefitted from tax credits totaling $2.3 million for our R&D expenditures. These credits reflected amounts for the full year 2015 following the extension of the R&D tax credit in December 2015. This amount also included an adjustment for recalculation of these tax credits from prior years resulting from a new regulation issued by the Treasury Department which favorably impacted the benefits provided to the Company under these rules. Benefits from R&D tax credits totaled $1.1 million in 2016, $2.3 million in 2015 and $393,000 in 2014. Benefits from tax incentives for domestic production totaled $1.2 million in 2016, $1.4 million in 2015 and $1.3 million in 2014. Benefits from changes in uncertain tax positions totaled $120,000 in 2016, $9,000 in 2015 and $217,000 in 2014. We expect our effective tax rate for 2017 to be approximately 33.0 percent. Accounting for stock based awards could create volatility in our effective tax rate depending upon the amount of exercise or vesting activity from these activities.

The effective tax rate for 2012 was impacted by a favorable adjustment to an uncertain tax position related to income tax credits claimed for R&D expenditures following the conclusion of an Internal Revenue Service examination of our United States federal income tax returns for 2006, 2007 and 2008. Benefits from tax incentives for domestic production totaled $1.3 million in 2014, $1.3 million in 2013 and $949,000 in 2012. Benefits from changes in uncertain tax positions totaled $217,000 in 2014, $195,000 in 2013 and $720,000 in 2012. We expect our effective tax rate for 2015 to be approximately 34.0 percent.

We are subject to United States federal income tax as well as to income tax of multiple state jurisdictions. We have concluded all United States federal income tax matters for years through 2010. In January 2009, the Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, began examining certain of our United States federal income tax returns for 2006, 2007 and 2008. This audit was favorably concluded in the third quarter of 2012 when the IRS appeals group allowed 100% of the tax credits claimed for our R&D expenditures during those years. Our unrecognized tax benefits were reduced at that time on the basis of this favorable settlement in the amount of approximately $641,000. All material state and local income tax matters have been concluded for years through 2010.

A well-targeted research and development program is an essential part of our activities, and we are currently engaged in a number of research and development projects. The objective of this program is to develop new products in our current product lines, improve current products and develop new product lines. The Company expects to continue additional research and development in 2014 in all these areas.
research and development
Our consolidated research and development expenditures for 2013, 2012 and 2011 were $4,288,000, $3,766,000 and $2,868,000, respectively.

In many of our markets, we compete with numerous other companies in the sale of healthcare products. These markets are dominated by established manufacturers that have broader product lines, greater distribution capabilities, substantially greater capital resources and larger marketing, research and development staffs and facilities than ours. Many of these competitors offer broader product lines within the specific product market and in the general field of medical devices and supplies. Broad product lines give many of our cardiovascular and fluid delivery competitors the ability to negotiate exclusive, long-term medical device supply contracts and, consequently, the ability to offer comprehensive pricing of their competing products. By offering a broader product line in the general field of medical devices and supplies, competitors may also have a significant advantage in marketing competing products to group purchasing organizations, Health Maintenance Organizations, or HMOs, and other managed care organizations that are increasingly seeking to reduce costs through centralization of purchasing functions. Furthermore, innovations in surgical techniques, product design or functions, or medical practices could have the effect of reducing or eliminating market demand for one or more of our products. In addition, our competitors may use price reductions to preserve market share in their product markets.

The manufacture and sale of medical products are subject to regulation by numerous United States governmental authorities, principally the FDA, and corresponding foreign agencies. The research and development, manufacturing, promotion, marketing and distribution of medical products in the United States are governed by the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and the regulations promulgated thereunder. All manufacturers of medical devices must register with the FDA and list all medical devices manufactured by them. The list must be updated annually. Our medical products subsidiaries and certain of our customers are subject to inspection by the FDA for compliance with such regulations and procedures and our medical products manufacturing facilities are subject to regulation by the FDA.

Our strategy is to provide a broad selection of products in the areas of our expertise. Research and development efforts are focused on improving current products and developing highly-engineered products that meet customer needs and serve niche markets with meaningful sales potential. Proposed new products may be subject to regulatory clearance or approval prior to commercialization and the time period for introducing a new product to the marketplace can be unpredictable. We also focus on controlling costs by investing in modern manufacturing technologies and controlling purchasing processes. We have been successful in consistently generating cash from operations and have used that cash to reduce or eliminate indebtedness, to fund capital expenditures, to make investment purchases, to repurchase stock and to pay dividends.

A well-targeted research and development program is an essential part of our activities, and we are currently engaged in a number of research and development projects. The objective of this program is to develop new products in our current product lines, improve current products and develop new product lines. The Company expects to continue additional research and development in 2011 in all these areas.
research and development
Our consolidated research and development expenditures for 2010, 2009 and 2008 were $2,669,000, $3,054,000, and $2,969,000, respectively.

In many of our markets, we compete with numerous other companies in the sale of healthcare products. These markets are dominated by established manufacturers that have broader product lines, greater distribution capabilities, substantially greater capital resources and larger marketing, research and development staffs and facilities than ours. Many of these competitors offer broader product lines within the specific product market and in the general field of medical devices and supplies. Broad product lines give many of our cardiovascular and fluid delivery competitors the ability to negotiate exclusive, long-term medical device supply contracts and, consequently, the ability to offer comprehensive pricing of their competing products. By offering a broader product line in the general field of medical devices and supplies, competitors may also have a significant advantage in marketing competing products to group purchasing organizations, HMOs and other managed care organizations that are increasingly seeking to reduce costs through centralization of purchasing functions. Furthermore, innovations in surgical techniques or medical practices could have the effect of reducing or eliminating market demand for one or more of our products. In addition, our competitors may use price reductions to preserve market share in their product markets.

The manufacture and sale of medical products are subject to regulation by numerous United States governmental authorities, principally the FDA, and corresponding foreign agencies. The research and development, manufacturing, promotion, marketing and distribution of medical products in the United States are governed by the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and the regulations promulgated thereunder. All manufacturers of medical devices must register with the FDA and list all medical devices manufactured by them. The list must be updated annually. Our medical products subsidiaries and certain of our customers are subject to inspection by the FDA for compliance with such regulations and procedures and our medical products manufacturing facilities are subject to regulation by the FDA.

Our strategy is to provide a broad selection of products in the areas of our expertise. Research and development efforts are focused on improving current products and developing highly-engineered products that meet customer needs in niche markets that are large enough to provide meaningful increases in sales. Proposed new products may be subject to regulatory clearance or approval prior to commercialization and the time period for introducing a new product to the marketplace can be unpredictable. We also focus on controlling costs by investing in modern manufacturing technologies and controlling purchasing processes. We have been successful in consistently generating cash from operations and have used that cash to reduce indebtedness, to fund capital expenditures, to make investment purchases, to repurchase stock and to pay dividends.

However, in many of the Company’s markets, the Company competes with numerous other companies in the sale of healthcare products. These markets are dominated by established manufacturers that have broader product lines, greater distribution capabilities, substantially greater capital resources and larger marketing, research and development staffs and facilities than those of the Company. Many of these competitors offer broader product lines within the specific product market and in the general field of medical devices and supplies. Broad product lines give many of the Company’s cardiovascular and fluid delivery competitors the ability to negotiate exclusive, long-term medical device supply contracts and, consequently, the ability to offer comprehensive pricing of their competing products. By offering a broader product line in the general field of medical devices and supplies, competitors may also have a significant advantage in marketing competing products to group purchasing organizations, HMOs and other managed care organizations that are increasingly seeking to reduce costs through centralization of purchasing functions. Furthermore, innovations in surgical techniques or medical practices could have the effect of reducing or eliminating market demand for one or more of the Company’s products. In addition, the Company’s competitors may use price reductions to preserve market share in their product markets.

The manufacture and sale of medical products are subject to regulation by numerous United States governmental authorities, principally the FDA, and corresponding foreign agencies. The research and development, manufacturing, promotion, marketing and distribution of medical products in the United States are governed by the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder (“FDC Act and Regulations”). All manufacturers of medical devices must register with the FDA and list all medical devices manufactured by them. The list must be updated annually. The Company’s medical product subsidiaries and certain of their customers are subject to inspection by the FDA for compliance with such regulations and procedures and the Company’s medical products manufacturing facilities are subject to regulation by the FDA.

The Company's strategy is to provide a broad selection of products in the areas of its expertise. Research and development efforts are focused on improving current products and developing highly-engineered products that meet customer needs and have the potential for broad market applications and significant sales. Proposed new products may be subject to regulatory clearance or approval prior to commercialization and the time period for introducing a new product to the marketplace can be unpredictable. The Company also focuses on controlling costs by investing in modern manufacturing technologies and controlling purchasing processes. The Company has been successful in consistently generating cash from operations and has used that cash to reduce indebtedness, to fund capital expenditures, to repurchase stock and, starting in 2003, to pay dividends.

Operating expenses were $17.6 million in 2007, compared with $18.1 million in 2006 and $16.3 million in 2005. The decrease in operating expenses in 2007 from 2006 was primarily related to the special item described below, partially offset by increases in selling (“Selling”) and general and administrative (“G&A”) expenses. In 2007, the Company recorded a $1.4 million benefit, net of expenses, related to a dispute settlement. This benefit was reflected as a reduction in operating expenses. Selling expenses consist primarily of salaries, commissions and other related expenses for sales and marketing personnel, marketing, advertising and promotional expenses. Selling expenses increased $286,000 in 2007, primarily as a result of increased outside services, promotion and advertising expenses. G&A expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related expenses of administrative, executive and financial personnel and outside professional fees. In 2007, G&A expenses increased $592,000, primarily attributable to a $329,000 charge related to the termination of certain pension plans, increased compensation and benefit costs partially offset by lower costs for outside services. The increase in operating expenses in 2006 from 2005 was primarily related to increased research and development (“R&D”), Selling and G&A expenses. R&D expenses increased $398,000 in 2006, primarily due to increased legal expenses, prototype supplies and compensation costs. Selling expenses increased $430,000 in 2006, primarily as a result of increased compensation costs, commissions, outside services, promotion and advertising. In 2006, G&A expenses increased $1.0 million, primarily due to outside services, taxes, compensation and benefits and costs associated with the relocation to the new facility for a subsidiary of the Company, Halkey-Roberts Corporation (“Halkey-Roberts”).

Benefits from changes in uncertain tax positions totaled $168,000 in 2007. The lower effective tax rate in 2006 is primarily a result of a review and documentation of the Company’s R&D tax credits for 2005 and prior-year tax returns which indicated that the Company was entitled to higher credits than had been claimed. The Company expects the effective tax rate for 2008 to be approximately 32.0 percent.

These markets are dominated by established manufacturers that have broader product lines, greater distribution capabilities, substantially greater capital resources and larger marketing, research and development staffs and facilities than the Company. Many of these competitors offer broader product lines within the specific product market and in the general field of medical devices and supplies. Broad product lines give many of the Company's cardiovascular and fluid delivery competitors the ability to negotiate exclusive, long-term medical device supply contracts and, consequently, the ability to offer comprehensive pricing of their competing products. By offering a broader product line in the general field of medical devices and supplies, competitors may also have a significant advantage in marketing competing products to group purchasing organizations, HMOs and other managed care organizations that are increasingly seeking to reduce costs through centralization of purchasing functions. In addition, the Company's competitors may use price reductions to preserve market share in their product markets.

The Company believes that a well-targeted research and development program is an essential part of the Company's activities, and the Company is currently engaged in a number of research and development projects. The objective of the Company's program is to develop new products in the Company's current product lines, improve current products and develop new product lines. Recent major development projects include, but are not limited to, a needleless injection site product designed to eliminate the use of needles by health care providers, a product designed for safe needle containment, a balloon catheter for use during balloon incisional dacryocystorhinosotomy surgery, a new inflator system for use with recreational and commercial life vests, an anti-retrograde flow check valve for medical infusion and fluid delivery applications and a silicone vessel loop for retracting and occluding vessels with improved securement capabilities. The Company expects to incur additional research and development expenses in 2004 for various projects, including further development of features and functionality of the MPS.
research and development
The Company's consolidated research and development expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 were $2,146,000, $2,180,000, and $1,911,000 respectively.

Depending on the product and the nature of the project, the Company competes on the basis of its ability to provide engineering and design expertise, quality, service, product and price. As such, successful competitors must have technical strength, responsiveness and scale. The Company believes that its expertise and reputation for quality medical products have allowed it to compete favorably with respect to each such factor and to maintain long-term relationships with its customers. However, in many of the Company's markets, the Company competes with numerous other companies that have substantially greater financial resources and engage in substantially more research and development activities than the Company. Furthermore, innovations in surgical techniques or medical practices could have the effect of reducing or eliminating market demand for one or more of the Company's products.

The Company focuses its research and development efforts to improve current products and develop highly-engineered products that meet customer needs and have the potential for broad market applications and significant sales. Proposed new products may be subject to regulatory clearance or approval prior to commercialization and the time period for introducing a new product to the marketplace can be unpredictable. The Company is also focused on controlling costs. The Company does this by investing in modern manufacturing technologies and controlling purchasing processes. Over the past three years, the Company has continued to be faced with increasing costs associated with all lines of insurance, including group health benefits. The Company has been successful in consistently generating cash from operations and uses that cash to reduce indebtedness, to fund capital expenditures, to repurchase stock and, starting in 2003, to pay dividends. During 2003, the Company reduced debt by approximately $6.0 million.

The Company anticipates that R&D expenses will continue at the current level for the foreseeable future. The decrease in operating expenses in 2002 from 2001 was primarily attributable to decreased G&A and Selling expenses partially offset by increased R&D expenses. G&A expenses for 2002 were $857,000 lower than G&A expenses for 2001, primarily due to a decrease in amortization expense as a result of a reduction in goodwill amortization in 2002 due to the adoption of SFAS No. 142 as discussed in Note 2 to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements included herein. Additionally, G&A expenses were lower in 2002 compared to 2001 primarily as a result of reduced depreciation and cost containment programs related to supplies, communication costs and professional fees. The decrease in Selling expenses of $905,000 in 2002 from 2001 was primarily related to reduced outside services (primarily related to clinical studies), reduced compensation costs and continuing cost reduction efforts. R&D expenses were $269,000 higher for 2002 compared with 2001. This increase was primarily related to increased product development activities.

By offering a broader product line in the general field of medical devices and supplies, competitors may also have a significant advantage in marketing competing products to group purchasing organizations, HMOs and other managed care organizations that are increasingly seeking to reduce costs through centralization of purchasing functions. In addition, Quest Medical's competitors may use price reductions to preserve market share in their product markets. The Company is not aware of any [integrated] cardioplegia delivery system currently being marketed that competes with the MPS.

Operating expenses were $16.0 million in 2001 compared with $15.6 million in 2000 and $16.5 million in 1999. The increase in operating expenses from 2000 to 2001 was primarily attributable to increased General and Administrative (G&A) expenses offset partially by reductions of Selling expenses and, to a lesser extent, Research and Development (R&D) expenses. G&A expenses for 2001 were $1.3 million higher than G&A expenses for 2000 primarily as a result of higher spending on outside services, compensation and benefit programs. The decrease in Selling expenses in 2001 from 2000 of $762,000 was primarily related to reductions in compensation

G&A expenses for 2000 were $446,000 less than the prior year primarily as a result of reduced spending on outside services and compensation and benefit programs. R&D expenses were $547,000 lower for 2000 as compared with 1999. This reduction resulted primarily from the Company's reduced R&D efforts on non-core products with limited market potential.

The Company believes that a well-targeted research and development program is an essential part of the Company's activities and is currently engaged in a number of research and development projects. The objective of the Company's program is to develop new products in the areas that the Company is currently engaged, improve current products and develop new products in other areas. Recent major development projects include, but are not limited to, a needleless valve product designed to eliminate the use of needles by health care providers, a back-up system for the MPS and disposable sets for use by the MPS in beating-heart surgery. The Company expects to incur additional research and development expenses in 2001 for various projects including further development of the MPS. Atrion Medical Products is EN46001 certified.
research and development
The Company's consolidated research and development expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998 were $2,054,000, $2,601,000 and $2,750,000 respectively.
research and development
Depending on the product and the nature of the project, the Company's medical products subsidiaries compete on the basis of their ability to provide engineering and design expertise, quality, service, product and price. As such, successful competitors must have technical strength, responsiveness and scale. The Company believes that its expertise and reputation for quality medical products have allowed it to compete favorably with respect to each such factor and to maintain long-term relationships with its customers. However, in many of the Company's markets, the Company competes with numerous other companies that have substantially greater financial resources and engage in substantially more research and development activities than the Company. Furthermore, innovations in surgical techniques or medical practices could have the effect of reducing or eliminating market demand for one or more of the Company's products.

Numerous companies compete with Quest Medical in the sale of cardiovascular products, specialized tubing sets and pressure monitoring kits. These markets are dominated by established manufacturers that have broader product lines, greater distribution capabilities, substantially greater capital resources and larger marketing, research and development staffs and facilities than Quest Medical. Many of these competitors offer broader product lines within the specific product market and in the general field of medical devices and supplies. Broad product lines give many of Quest Medical's competitors the ability to negotiate exclusive, long-term medical device supply contracts and, consequently, the ability to offer comprehensive pricing of their competing products.

Operating expenses were $15.6 million in 2000 compared with $16.5 million in 1999 and $14.9 million in 1998. The decrease in operating expenses from 1999 to 2000 was primarily attributable to reduced General and Administrative (G&A) expenses and reduced Research and Development (R&D) expenses. G&A expenses for 2000 were $446,000 lower than G&A expenses for 1999 primarily as a result of lower spending on outside services, compensation and benefit programs. R&D expenses were $547,000 lower for 2000 as compared with 1999. This reduction is primarily the result of the Company's reduced R&D efforts on non-core products with limited market potential. The increase in operating expenses from 1998 to 1999 was primarily attributable to the expansion of marketing efforts associated with the MPS product line. The increase in operating expenses for 1999 over 1998 was also the result of the inclusion of the operation of Quest Medical for twelve months in 1999 compared with the inclusion of the Quest Medical operation in 1998 for the eleven months subsequent to its acquisition in late January 1998.

Income tax expense in 2000 totaled $923,000 compared with $741,000 in 1999 and $735,000 in 1998. An increase in the Company's foreign sales corporation benefit and an increase in the Company's research and development tax credit resulted in a lower effective income tax rate for 2000 and 1999 compared with 1998.

The AP50 pilot plant is the first step in a planned ten-year $1.8 billion investment program in Quebecs Saguenay  Lac-Saint-Jean region, involving up to an additional 390 kt of new smelting capacity by 2015, developed by Alcan with the support of the Quebec Government. The Government in an agreement has provided financial support by means of research and development tax incentives and loans, and has made available up to two billion KWh per year of additional power to support the investment program. Support from the Government of Canada is expected to be provided through existing research and development incentive programs. The agreement with the Quebec Government also reinforces Alcans electrical power position through the long-term extension of hydraulic leases and new power contracts which, taken together with Alcans proprietary generation system, provide a secure supply of approximately 2,600 MWh of low-cost power through the year 2045.

business unit manufactures coils and sheet for customers in the beverage and closures, automotive, customized industrial sheet, and high-quality bright surface products markets. It includes world-class rolling and recycling operations, as well as dedicated R&D capabilities. The business, which comprises the Neuf Brisach rolling mill in France and the Singen rolling mill in Germany, had third-party sales and operating revenues of $1.5 billion in 2006, up 33% from the prior year. While the increase largely reflected the impact of higher LME aluminum prices and the strengthening euro, the business was also successful in achieving volume, mix and margin improvements. Demand for sheet products in Europe grew at a somewhat faster pace than the general economy, driven by good growth in the beverage can and building sectors. During 2006, the Company announced several capital projects for the Neuf Brisach facility including a $10-million upgrade of annealing and quenching equipment for automotive applications, a $15-million expansion of finishing capacity for beverage can sheet and a $7-million investment to increase used beverage cans (UBC) recycling capabilities. In October 2006, a multi-year agreement was signed with Valeo (France), a leading auto parts manufacturer, for the supply of sheet for automotive heat exchangers.

Adjustments to reflect the research and development and other services rendered between Alcan and Novelis. These adjustments arise due to the change in relationship between Alcan and Novelis subsequent to the spin-off. Prior to the spin-off, all revenues and expenses related to these services rendered were eliminated upon consolidation in Alcans Financial Statements. Subsequent to the spin-off, these revenues and expenses are considered third party and are not eliminated.

8. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
r&d
Research and development comprises a global system of research laboratories, applied engineering centers and plant technical departments. The research laboratories, responsible for approximately 50 % of the total R&D expenses for Alcan, play a major role in innovation through basic and applied research. Two laboratories are located in Canada (at Kingston, Ontario, and Jonquiere, Quebec), one is in the U.K. (Banbury, Oxfordshire) and one is in Switzerland (Neuhausen). Together, they employ about 600 people. In recent years, Alcan's R&D effort has been refocused on core processes and products. Research and Development expenses for Alcan were $81 million in 2000, $67 million in 1999 and $70 million in 1998. Additionally, intellectual

research and development
A second and significant component of the 2002 research and development program was the emphasis placed on regulatory affairs as the Company is faced with increasingly more stringent and sophisticated demands from the regulatory agencies that control introduction of products to the market. While the Company typically depends on contract assistance to submit registrations in foreign markets, all submissions, support documentation and any supportive data that may be needed are generated and compiled in-house by Alcide's own regulatory specialists.
research and development
While many of the research and development programs undertaken by the Company and described hereafter, give evidence of possible success, the nature of research, coupled with the necessity for regulatory approval is such that there can be no assurance of ultimate program success or that any resulting product may be commercially viable.
research and development
During fiscal 2002, Food Safety research and development activities were heavily weighted toward process validation under commercial conditions. Four process development engineers and one to two Food Safety technicians were devoted full-time to this activity during the fiscal year with primary activities directed toward documenting shelf-life extension for various produce items, process validation work on sausages and comminuted meats and process development for red meat parts and trim. These efforts were supported by Alcide's laboratory staff and outside consultants having expertise in produce and meat processing.
research and development
In fiscal 2003, the primary focus of Alcide research and development will be in three key areas. The first of these will be the development and submission of a Food Additive Petition to further expand the dose levels of acidified sodium chlorite that are currently approved on seafood. The second area of focus is expected to be in the development of the additional performance data that will be necessary to extend the current "time-limited" SANOVA pathogen reduction claims for produce into a full claim for the product. Finally, the third key area of focus in fiscal 2003 is expected to be in the expansion of approvals for SANOVA use on foods into the international market. Several large markets with significant potential for use of the SANOVA process have already been identified and efforts will therefore be focused on the submission of an "international registration dossier" into each of these new markets seeking ultimate acceptance for all of the currently approved domestic uses.
research and development
The Company also has relationships with, and from time to time engages the services of, university professors and other qualified consultants to assist it in technological research and development.

Research and Development Expense
research and development
Research and development expenses of $2,639,877 for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2002, were 6% or $160,026 higher than incurred in fiscal 2001. The increase was caused primarily by filling staff positions that were vacant during the preceding year coupled with a $101,000 increase in expenses paid to regulatory consultants hired to assist in registration of SANOVA for new product categories.
research and development
During fiscal 2002, the Company recorded income tax expense of $838,235 at an effective tax rate of 32%, as compared to an income tax expense of $825,360 at an effective rate of 34.9% during fiscal 2001. The lower rate recorded for fiscal 2002 reflects primarily the cumulative benefit of research and development tax credits and extraterritorial income exclusion.
research and development
Research and development expenses of $2,479,851 for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2001 were $684,598, or 38% higher than for fiscal 2000 primarily as a result of process development engineering expenses related to development of SANOVA applications for red meat parts/trim and red meat carcass interventions.

Certain reclassifications have been made to prior year financial statements to conform to the current year presentation. In fiscal 2002 during management's review of research and development expenses for the purpose of determining allowable expenses for research and development credits for income tax purposes, it came to management's attention that certain design and development expenses that had been previously classified as general and administrative, more closely relate to research and development expense. The amount reclassified from general and administrative expense to research and development expense for fiscal 2001 was $687,182. No reclassification was made for fiscal 2000 as the Company was not engaged in these design and development activities prior to fiscal 2001.

research and development
Substantially all of the research and product development activities conducted by the Company during fiscal 2001 were funded by the Company. It is expected that research and development programs during fiscal 2002 will again be funded primarily by the Company and conducted under the Company's direct supervision, either in its own laboratories, in contract laboratories or, in the case of food antimicrobials, in commercial plant environments.
r&d
The immediate potential for expansion of SANOVA technology in the poultry, red meat and other markets has caused the Company to direct R&D resources to this growing opportunity while maintaining product superiority and market share stability for Alcide's established udder care products. No further effort has been expended on the development of Alcide's human preoperative skin antiseptic and anti-infective oral care products.
research and development
While many of the research and development programs undertaken by the Company, and described hereafter, give evidence of possible success, the nature of research, coupled with the necessity for regulatory approval, is such that there can be no assurance of ultimate program success or that any resulting product will be commercially successful.
r&d
During fiscal 2002 the SANOVA food safety R&D program will continue to focus on commercial plant optimization testing related to new use areas. Specifically, efforts will be significantly directed towards the optimization of several major use opportunities in the fruit and vegetable markets.
r&d
The primary R&D focus during fiscal 2001 was on the continued development of new products which enhance the performance of our line of teat dips and on the regulatory filings required to obtain launch approval for these products.

Research and development expenses of $1,795,253 for the 12-month period ended May 31, 2000 were $487,924 lower than for the 12-month period last year. Fiscal 1999 R&D expenses included $317,000 in costs associated with the negotiated termination of the Company's contract with Novus International, Inc. The balance of the year-to-year difference results primarily from reduction in plant validation testing associated with introduction of SANOVA to the poultry industry.

The Company is subject to extensive and complex laws and regulations that affect the land development process, including laws and regulations related to zoning and permitted land uses. Government entities have adopted or may approve regulations or laws that could negatively impact the availability of land and development opportunities within those areas. For example, in December 2007, Maui County adopted an ordinance requiring verification of water source availability and sustainability for all developments prior to submission of subdivision construction plans. This requirement adds further process delays and burdens the developer with identifying and developing new water sources. It is possible that increasingly stringent requirements will be imposed on developers in the future that could adversely affect the Company’s ability to develop projects in the affected markets or could require that the Company satisfy additional administrative and regulatory requirements, which could delay development progress or increase the development costs of the Company. Any such delays or costs could have an adverse effect on the Company’s revenues and earnings.
development cost
As discussed in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, revenues from real estate sales are generally recognized when sales are closed and title, risks and rewards passes to the buyer. For certain real estate sales, the Company and its joint venture partners account for revenues on long-term real estate development projects that have continuing post-closing involvement, such as Kukui`ula, using the percentage-of-completion method. Following this method, the amount of revenue recognized is based on the percentage of development costs that have been incurred through the reporting period in relation to total expected development cost associated with the subject property. Accordingly, if material changes to total expected development costs or revenues occur, the Company’s financial condition or its future operating results could be materially impacted.
development cost
For development projects, capitalized costs are allocated using the direct method for expenditures that are specifically associated with the unit being sold and the relative-sales-value method for expenditures that benefit the entire project. Capitalized development costs typically include costs related to land acquisition, grading, roads, water and sewage systems, landscaping, capitalized interest, and project amenities. Direct overhead costs incurred after the development project is substantially complete, such as utilities, maintenance, and real estate taxes, are charged to selling, general, and administrative expense as incurred. All indirect overhead costs are charged to selling, general, and administrative costs as incurred.
development cost
Sales are recorded when the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the buyers (generally on closing dates), adequate initial and continuing investments have been received, and collection of remaining balances, if any, is reasonably assured. For certain development projects that have continuing post-closing involvement and for which total revenue and capital costs are reasonably estimable, the Company uses the percentage-of-completion method for revenue recognition. Under this method, the amount of revenue recognized is based on development costs that have been incurred through the reporting period as a percentage of total expected development cost associated with the development project. This generally results in a stabilized gross margin percentage, but requires significant judgment and estimates.

Capitalized development costs typically include costs related to land acquisition, grading, roads, water and sewage systems, landscaping, capitalized interest, and project amenities. Direct overhead costs incurred after the development project is substantially complete, such as utilities, maintenance, and real estate taxes, are charged to selling, general, and administrative expense as incurred. All indirect overhead costs are charged to selling, general, and administrative costs as incurred.
development cost
Sales are recorded when the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the buyers (generally on closing dates), adequate initial and continuing investments have been received, and collection of remaining balances, if any, is reasonably assured. For certain development projects that have material continuing post-closing involvement and for which total revenue and capital costs are reasonably estimable, the Company uses the percentage-of-completion method for revenue recognition. Under this method, the amount of revenue recognized is based on development costs that have been incurred through the reporting period as a percentage of total expected development cost associated with the development project. This generally results in a stabilized gross margin percentage, but requires significant judgment and estimates.

Costs of growing and harvesting sugar cane are charged to the cost of inventory in the year incurred and to cost of sales as raw sugar is sold. Costs of growing coffee, excluding orchard development costs, are charged to inventory in the year incurred and to cost of sales as coffee is sold.

The Company is subject to extensive and complex laws and regulations that affect the land development process, including laws and regulations related to zoning and permitted land uses. Government entities have adopted or may approve regulations or laws that could negatively impact the availability of land and development opportunities within those areas. For example, in December 2007, Maui County adopted an ordinance requiring verification of water source availability and sustainability for all developments prior to submission of subdivision construction plans. This requirement adds further process delays and burdens the developer with identifying and developing new water sources. It is possible that increasingly stringent requirements will be imposed on developers in the future that could adversely affect the Company’s ability to develop projects in the affected markets or could require that the Company satisfy additional administrative and regulatory requirements, which could delay development progress or increase the development costs of the Company. Any such delays or costs could have an adverse effect on the Company’s revenues and earnings.

As discussed in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, revenues from real estate sales are generally recognized when sales are closed and title, risk and rewards passes to the buyer. For certain real estate sales, the Company and its joint venture partners account for revenues on long-term real estate development projects that have material continuing post-closing involvement, such as Kukui`ula, using the percentage-of-completion method. Following this method, the amount of revenue recognized is based on the percentage of development costs that have been incurred through the reporting period in relation to total expected development cost associated with the subject property. Accordingly, if material changes to total expected development costs or revenues occur, the Company’s financial condition and/or its future operating results could be materially impacted.

Kukui'Ula Development Company: The Kukui'Ula project on the island of Kauai comprises 1,000 acres on the southern coast of Kauai, adjacent to the Poipu resort. The project is planned for a resort, an 18-hole golf course, residential and commercial use, and parks and open space. In 2002, A&B Properties, Inc. ("Properties"), a subsidiary of A&B, accelerated development plans for Kukui'Ula by entering into a joint venture with an affiliate of DMB Associates, Inc. DMB is an Arizona-based developer of large master-planned communities. During 2003, Properties contributed to the venture, title to 846 acres, a waste water treatment plant, and other improvements, totaling approximately $28 million. The balance of the land will be transferred to the venture upon securing further entitlements for the property. DMB will fund all future development costs, subject to an option available to Properties, which diminishes over time, to participate in a portion of that funding. In July 2003, the State Land Use Commission granted urban designation for the project's remaining acres, which will allow the entire 1,000-acre property to be developed as one integrated project. The Kauai County Planning Commission recommended approval of the applications on January 27, 2004, and action is anticipated by the County Council by the third quarter of 2004. The venture had no sales activity during 2003.

On August 1, 2000, the Company obtained a $50,000,000 secured line of credit from Vornado under the same terms and conditions as the existing $95,000,000 loan from Vornado, including the interest rate of 15.72%. The maturity date of the existing $95,000,000 loan has been extended to March 15, 2002, which is also the maturity date of the new line of credit. The interest rate on the loan and line of credit will reset on March 15, 2001, using the same spread to treasuries as presently exists. The proceeds of the secured line of credit are being used for general corporate purposes including continuing to fund the real estate development costs at its Lexington Avenue property. It is expected that a construction loan will be obtained to finance the development of the Lexington Avenue property.

As of July 31, 2012, we had two part-time employees, of whom one was engaged in clinical and pre-clinical research and development activities and the other was engaged in administration and management. All of our employees have entered into confidentiality agreements with us. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement.
research and development
We will need additional funding to support our operations and capital expenditures. Such funds may not be available to us, which lack of availability could reduce our research and development activities and future business prospects.
research and development
While we need to raise significant additional funds, we currently have no committed sources of additional capital, and there can be no assurance that any financing arrangements will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. Furthermore, the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities may result in additional dilution to existing stockholders. If adequate additional funds are not available, we may be required to delay, reduce the scope of or eliminate material parts of the implementation of our business strategy. This limitation would impede our growth and could result in a contraction of our operations, which would reduce our research and development activities and future business prospects.
research and development
We are engaged in highly competitive fields of pharmaceutical research and development. Competition from numerous existing companies and others entering the fields in which we operate is intense and expected to increase. We expect to compete with, among others, conventional pharmaceutical companies. Most of these companies have substantially greater research and development, manufacturing, marketing, financial, technological personnel and managerial resources than we do. Acquisitions of competing companies by large pharmaceutical or health care companies could further enhance such competitors’ financial, marketing and other resources. Moreover, competitors that are able to complete clinical trials, obtain required regulatory approvals and commence commercial sales of their products before we do may enjoy a significant competitive advantage over us. There are also existing therapies that may compete with the products we are developing. There can be no assurance we will be able to successfully compete against these other entities.

Since our inception in 1981, we have devoted the vast majority of our resources to the research and development of ONCONASE

Research and development expense for fiscal 2012 was $0.3 million compared to $0.8 million for fiscal 2011, a decrease of $0.5 million, or 63%.
research and development
The Company has financed its operations since inception primarily through the sale of our equity securities and convertible debentures in registered offerings and private placements. Additionally, we have raised capital through other debt financings, the sale of our state tax benefit and research products. Because our business does not generate positive cash flow from operating activities, the Company will need to raise additional capital in order to fully commercialize our product or to fund development efforts relating to additional indications. To the extent additional capital is not available when needed, the Company may be forced to abandon some or all of its development and commercialization efforts, which would have a material adverse effect on the prospects of the business. Based upon the reduced operations, we currently believe that our cash reserves can support our activities through September 2013. We may seek to satisfy future funding requirements through public or private offerings of securities or with collaborative or other arrangements with corporate partners. Additional financing or strategic transactions may not be available when needed or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. If adequate financing is not available, we may be required to delay, scale back, or eliminate certain of our research and development programs, relinquish rights to certain of our technologies, drugs or products, or license third parties to commercialize products or technologies that we would otherwise seek to develop ourselves.

The primary function of the Research Committee is to work closely with management and the Scientific Advisory Board to provide support and direction to the Company’s research and development programs. The Research Committee functions as an advisory committee and does not hold formal committee meetings or take formal committee actions.

In addition, uncertainty exists as to the Company’s ability to protect its rights to patents and its proprietary information. There can also be no assurance that research and discoveries by others will not render some or all of the Company’s technology or drug product candidates noncompetitive or obsolete. Nor can there be any assurance that unforeseen problems will not develop with the Company’s technologies or applications, or that the Company will be able to address successfully technological challenges it encounters in its research and development programs. While the Company maintains insurance to cover the use of its drug product candidates in clinical trials, it does not maintain insurance covering the sale of its products nor is there any assurance that it will be able to obtain or maintain such insurance on acceptable terms or with adequate coverage against potential liabilities.

New Jersey has legislation permitting certain corporations in New Jersey to sell a portion of their state tax loss carry forwards and state research and development credits to obtain tax benefits. For the state fiscal 2010 (July 1, 2009 to June 30, 2010), we had $723,000 of total available state tax benefit that was saleable. In February 2010, we received $647,000 from the sale of our total available state tax benefit, which was recognized as state tax benefit in fiscal 2010. In fiscal 2011, the Company did not qualify for state tax benefits.

At July 31, 2011, cash and equivalents totaled $0.3 million, as compared to $1.5 million at July 31, 2010 (including restricted cash). During fiscal 2011, we used $0.5 million of cash in our operating activities. This amount compares to $2.8 million used in our operating activities during fiscal 2010. The decrease of $2.3 million is primarily due to our reduced clinical and pre-clinical research and development efforts for ONCONASE

research and development
Because we are an emerging company with limited resources, and because completing and submitting an NDA is an expensive process, we must regularly assess the most efficient allocation of our research and development budget. As a result, we may have to further prioritize development activities and may not be able to fully realize the value of some of our drug product candidates in a timely manner, and they may be delayed in reaching the market, if at all. A reduction in spending on our other drug product candidates could delay our commercialization efforts and negatively impact our ability to diversify our development risk across a broad portfolio of drug product candidates.
research and development
If we obtain regulatory approval for any of our drug product candidates, the extent to which they achieve market acceptance will depend, in part, on competitive factors. Competition in our industry is intense, and it is increased by the rapid pace of technological development. Existing drug products or new drug products developed by our competitors may be more effective or have fewer side effects, or may be more effectively marketed and sold, than any that we may develop. Our principal competitors have substantially greater research and development capabilities and experience and greater manufacturing, marketing, financial, and managerial resources than we do. Competitive drug compounds may render our technology and drug product candidates obsolete or noncompetitive prior to our recovery of research, development, or commercialization expenses incurred through sales of any of our drug product candidates. The FDA’s policy of granting “fast track” approval for cancer therapies may also expedite the regulatory approval of our competitors’ drug product candidates.
research and development
Our research and development processes involve the controlled storage, use, and disposal of hazardous materials and biological hazardous materials. We are subject to federal, state, and local laws and regulations governing the use, manufacture, storage, handling, and disposal of hazardous materials and certain waste products. Although we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of these hazardous materials comply with the standards prescribed by law and regulation, the risk of accidental contamination or injury from hazardous materials cannot be completely eliminated. In the event of an accident, even by a third party, we could be held liable for any damages that result, and such liability could exceed the $2,000,000 limit of our current general liability insurance coverage and our financial resources. In the future, we may not be able to maintain insurance on acceptable terms, or at all. We could also be required to incur significant costs to comply with current or future environmental laws and regulations.

We have incurred net losses during each year since our inception. The net loss for fiscal year 2009 was approximately $4.5 million as compared to $12.3 million in fiscal year 2008.

The cumulative loss from the date of inception, August 24, 1981 to July 31, 2009, amounted to $108.9 million. Such losses are attributable to the fact that we are still in the development stage and, accordingly, have not derived sufficient revenues from operations to offset the development stage expenses.

New Jersey has enacted legislation permitting certain corporations located in New Jersey to sell a portion of its state tax loss carryforwards and state research and development credits in order to obtain state tax benefits. For the state fiscal year 2009 (July 1, 2008 to June 30, 2009), the Company had approximately $1,274,000 of total available state tax benefit that was saleable. On December 1, 2008, the Company received approximately $1,140,000 from the sale of its total available state tax benefit, which was recognized as state tax benefit in the fiscal year ended July 31, 2009.

If still available under New Jersey law, the Company will attempt to qualify and sell its new state tax benefit between July 1, 2008 and June 30, 2009 (state fiscal year 2009) in the amount of approximately $722,000. This amount represents the net losses and research and development credits during the state fiscal year 2009. The Company cannot estimate, however, what percentage of its saleable state tax benefit New Jersey will permit it to sell, how much money will be received in connection with the sale, if any, if the Company will be able to qualify and find a buyer for its state tax benefit or if such funds will be available in a timely manner.

A Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) with the National Cancer Institute, or NCI, has produced RN321, a conjugate of ranpirnase with a monoclonal antibody, that has demonstrated activity against non-Hodgkins lymphoma in preclinical studies. The relative benefit of killing targeted tumor cells versus non-targeted healthy cells, or the therapeutic index, is greater than 200,000-fold with this conjugate. This CRADA has been concluded and data published. As a result of these findings we are working with our collaborators on the development of first and second generation huRFB4 - ONCONASE

Additional financing may not be available when we need it or be on terms acceptable to us. If adequate financing is not available, we may be required to delay, scale-back, or eliminate certain of our research and development programs, to relinquish rights to some of our technologies or products, or to grant licenses to third parties to commercialize products or technologies that we would otherwise seek to develop ourselves. We could also be required to cease operations. If additional capital is raised through the sale of equity, our stockholders ownership interest could be diluted and such newly-issued securities may have rights, preferences, or privileges superior to those of our other stockholders. The terms of any debt securities we may sell to raise additional capital may place restrictions on our operating activities.
research and development
Because we are an emerging company with limited resources, and because completing and submitting an NDA is an expensive process, we must regularly assess the most efficient allocation of our research and development budget. As a result, we may have to further prioritize development activities and may not be able to fully realize the value of some of our drug product candidates in a timely manner, and they may be delayed in reaching the market, if at all. A reduction in spending on our other drug product candidates could delay our commercialization efforts and negatively impact our ability to diversify our development risk across a broad portfolio of drug product candidates.
research and development
If we obtain regulatory approval for any of our drug product candidates, the extent to which they achieve market acceptance will depend, in part, on competitive factors. Competition in our industry is intense, and it is increased by the rapid pace of technological development. Existing drug products or new drug products developed by our competitors may be more effective or have fewer side effects, or may be more effectively marketed and sold, than any that we may develop. Our principal competitors have substantially greater research and development capabilities and experience and greater manufacturing, marketing, financial, and managerial resources than we do. Competitive drug compounds may render our technology and drug product candidates obsolete or noncompetitive prior to our recovery of research, development, or commercialization expenses incurred through sales of any of our
research and development
Our research and development processes involve the controlled storage, use, and disposal of hazardous materials and biological hazardous materials. We are subject to federal, state, and local laws and regulations governing the use, manufacture, storage, handling, and disposal of hazardous materials and certain waste products. Although we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of these hazardous materials comply with the standards prescribed by law and regulation, the risk of accidental contamination or injury from hazardous materials cannot be completely eliminated. In the event of an accident, even by a third party, we could be held liable for any damages that result, and such liability could exceed the $2,000,000 limit of our current general liability insurance coverage and our financial resources. In the future, we may not be able to maintain insurance on acceptable terms, or at all. We could also be required to incur significant costs to comply with current or future environmental laws and regulations.

We fund the research and development of our products primarily from cash receipts resulting from the sale of our equity securities and convertible debentures in registered offerings and private placements. Additionally, we have raised capital through other debt financings, the sale of our tax benefits and research products, interest income and financing received from our CEO. During the fiscal year ended July 31, 2008, we received net proceeds of approximately $0.7 million as a result of private placements of common stock and from exercises of stock options and warrants. These proceeds will be used primarily to complete our confirmatory Phase IIIb clinical trial and support our anticipated filing of an NDA of ONCONASE

Research and development expense for fiscal year 2008 was $8.5 million compared to $5.5 million for fiscal year 2007, an increase of approximately $3 million, or 53.4% . The increase in research and development expenses is directly related to increased expenses of approximately $3.2 million related to our preparations for the completion of the ONCONASE

New Jersey has enacted legislation permitting certain corporations located in New Jersey to sell a portion of its state tax loss carryforwards and state research and development credits in order to obtain tax benefits. For the state fiscal year 2008 (July 1, 2007 to June 30, 2008), we had approximately $2.5 million of total available state tax benefits that qualified for sale, of which New Jersey permitted us to sell approximately $2.0 million. In December 2007, we received approximately $1.8 million from the sale of these state tax benefits, which was recognized as state tax benefit in the fiscal year ended July 31, 2008.
research and development
We have incurred net losses during each year since our inception. The net loss for fiscal year 2008 was approximately $12.3 million as compared to $8.8 million in fiscal year 2007. The increased net loss was primarily related to the increased research and development expenses in 2008. The cumulative loss from the date of inception, August 24, 1981 to July 31, 2008, amounted to $104.4 million. Such losses are attributable to the fact that we are still in the development stage and, accordingly, have not derived sufficient revenues from operations to offset the development stage expenses.
research and development
Research and development expense for fiscal year 2007 was $5.5 million compared to $5.2 million for fiscal year 2006, an increase of approximately $0.3 million, or 5.7%. The increase primarily resulted from increased compensation expense related to employee salaries and benefits of approximately $0.5 million mostly due to increased stock-based compensation expenses in 2007, in addition to an increase of approximately $0.2 million in expenses incurred from our ongoing Phase I/II ONCONASE

In addition, uncertainty exists as to the Companys ability to protect its rights to patents and its proprietary information. There can also be no assurance that research and discoveries by others will not render some or all of the Companys technology or drug product candidates noncompetitive or obsolete. Nor can there be any assurance that unforeseen problems will not develop with the Companys technologies or applications, or that the Company will be able to address successfully technological challenges it encounters in its research and development programs. While the Company maintains insurance to cover the use of its drug product candidates in clinical trials, it does not maintain insurance covering the sale of its products nor is there any assurance that it will be able to obtain or maintain such insurance on acceptable terms or with adequate coverage against potential liabilities.

Research and development expense for fiscal year 2006 was approximately $5.2 million compared to approximately $5.1 million for fiscal year 2005, an increase of approximately $0.1 million, or 3%. The increase was primarily due to increased compensation expense of approximately $0.5 which is primarily related to share-based compensation. This increase was offset by a decrease in patent expenses of approximately $0.2 million and completion of key toxicology requirements and key requirements for chemistry, manufacturing and controls for our anticipated ONCONASE

New Jersey has enacted legislation permitting certain corporations located in New Jersey to sell a portion of its state tax loss carryforwards and state research and development credits in order to obtain tax benefits. For the state fiscal year 2006 (July 1, 2005 to June 30, 2006), we had approximately $1.9 million of total available state tax benefits that were saleable; of which New Jersey permitted us to sell approximately $0.4 million.

Such additional funds may not become available as the Company may need them or be available on acceptable terms. Insufficient funds could require the Company to delay, scale back, or eliminate one or more of its research and development programs or to license third parties to commercialize drug product candidates or technologies that the Company would otherwise seek to develop without relinquishing its rights thereto. Until and unless the Company’s operations generate significant revenues, the Company expects to continue to fund operations from equity financing. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to raise the capital it needs on terms which are acceptable, if at all. The Company may also obtain additional capital through the exercise of outstanding options and warrants and the sale of its tax benefits, although it cannot provide any assurance of such exercises or sale or the amount of capital it will receive, if any.

Our research and development programs focus primarily on the development of therapeutics from amphibian ribonucleases. Because ribonucleases have been shown to be involved in the regulation of cell proliferation, maturation, differentiation and programmed cell death, known as apoptosis, ribonucleases may be ideal candidates for the development of therapeutics for the treatment of cancer and other life-threatening diseases, including viral and autoimmune diseases that require anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic properties.

We have established a number of scientific collaborations with academic and research institutions including the NCI. The objective of our collaboration with the NCI is to develop new therapeutic applications for ONCONASE(R). This collaboration has produced RN321, a conjugate of ranpirnase, with a monoclonal antibody that demonstrated activity in treating non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in preclinical studies. The relative benefit in killing targeted tumor cells versus non-targeted healthy cells, or the therapeutic index, is greater than 200,000-fold with this conjugate. These "proof-of-concept" results were presented at the 2002 Ribonuclease Meeting in Bath, England. The positive results of the initial NCI studies have been independently confirmed.

Since our inception, we have devoted the vast majority of our resources to the research and development of ONCONASE(R) and related drug candidates. We have focused our resources towards the completion of the clinical program for unresectable, or inoperable, malignant mesothelioma.
research and development
Almost all of the $55,267,000 of research and development expenses we have incurred since our inception has gone toward the development of ONCONASE(R) and related drug candidates. For the fiscal years 2006, 2005 and 2004 our research and development expenses were $5,230,000, $5,082,000 and $3,353,000, respectively, almost all of which were used for the development of ONCONASE(R) and related drug candidates. ONCONASE(R) is currently in an international, centrally randomized, confirmatory Phase IIIb registration trial. The first part of the trial has been completed. The second confirmatory part of the trial is ongoing. The primary endpoint of the trial is overall survival. The first interim analysis results based on one third of the required events (deaths) of the study, which evaluates the efficacy, safety and tolerability of the combination of ONCONASE + doxorubicin as compared to doxorubicin alone have been reported. The overall median survival time (MST) demonstrated a trend favoring the ONCONASE + doxorubicin treatment group (12 months) over the doxorubicin group (10 months). A two month improvement in median survival had previously been observed in the Treatment Target Group (n=104) analysis from the completed Phase III single agent study that favored the ONCONASE over doxorubicin treatments (11.6 months vs. 9.6 months). The Company's Phase IIIb confirmatory registration trial was designed based on the conclusions drawn from the TTG analysis but powered to reach a statistically significant difference in MST between the ONCONASE + doxorubicin treatment group and the doxorubicin treatment group at 316 events. The interim data which represented only one third of the planned number of events was sufficient for us to continue the trial as planned, but was not sufficient for supporting the filing for marketing approvals at that time. At this time, we cannot predict with certainty when a sufficient number of deaths will occur to achieve statistical significance. The timing of when we will be able to file for marketing registrations in the US, EU and Australia is data driven. Therefore, we cannot predict with certainty what our total cost associated with obtaining marketing approvals will be, or when and if such approvals will be granted, or when actual sales will occur. We have completed the chemistry, manufacturing and controls (CMC) section of the NDA and will submit it after completion of a review by external regulatory consultants.

Research and development expense for fiscal 2006 was $5,230,000 compared to $5,082,000 for fiscal 2005, an increase of $148,000, or 3%. The increase was primarily due to the compensation expense of approximately $458,000 which is primarily related to share-based compensation; and non-cash expense related to stock options issued to consultants of approximately $93,000. The share-based compensation expense is expected to continue as a result of the adoption of SFAS 123(R), which requires us to charge compensation expense for all employee stock options. These increases were offset by a decrease in patent expenses of approximately $170,000; completion of key toxicology requirements and key requirements for chemistry, manufacturing and controls resulting in a decrease in expenses of approximately $116,000; a decrease in pre-clinical sponsored research and development expenses of approximately $82,000; and a reduction in costs related to clinical trials of approximately $35,000.

Research and development expense for fiscal 2005 was $5,082,000 compared to $3,353,000 for fiscal 2004, an increase of $1,729,000, or 52%. The increase was primarily due to expenses in connection with preparing our NDA for ONCONASE(R), including the completion of key toxicology requirements and key requirements for chemistry, manufacturing and controls, including the ONCONASE(R) stability program of approximately $1,040,000. This increase also resulted from pre-clinical sponsored research and development expenses; the new Phase II program for non-small cell lung, including consulting fees of approximately $292,000; expansion of the confirmatory Phase IIIb clinical trial in countries outside of the European Union, including the retention of another clinical research organization to assure regulatory compliance in the conduct of the trial in these countries; grant payments; clinical monitoring and data management fees related to our pivotal Phase III clinical trial for malignant mesothelioma of approximately $264,000; increases in patent expenses of approximately $190,000; personnel costs of approximately $71,000 and depreciation expense and equipment repairs and maintenance of approximately $21,000; offset by a decrease in the non-cash expense related to stock options issued for consulting services of approximately $149,000.

Since our inception, we have devoted the vast majority of our resources to the research and development of ONCONASE(R) and related drug candidates. We have focused our resources towards the completion of the clinical program for unresectable, or inoperable, malignant mesothelioma.
research and development
Almost all of our research and development expenses since our inception of $50,037,251 have gone toward the development of ONCONASE(R) and related drug candidates. For the fiscal years 2005, 2004 and 2003 our research and development expenses were $5,082,000, $3,353,000 and $1,700,000, respectively, almost all of which were used for the development of ONCONASE(R) and related drug candidates. ONCONASE(R) is currently in an international, centrally randomized Phase III trial. The first part of the trial has been completed and the second confirmatory part of the trial is ongoing for which nearly 90% of the patients required per the study design for full patient accrual have now been enrolled. The primary endpoint of the trial is survival, and as such, a sufficient number of deaths must occur in order to perform the required statistical analyses to determine the efficacy of ONCONASE(R) in patients with unresectable (inoperable) malignant mesothelioma. If the results of the clinical trials are positive, we expect to file for marketing registrations (NDA and MAA) for ONCONASE(R) within six months of completion of the statistical analyses. However, at this time, we cannot predict with certainty when a sufficient number of deaths will occur to achieve statistical significance. Hence, the timing of when we will be able to file for marketing registrations in the US and EU is data driven. Therefore, we cannot predict with certainty what our total cost associated with obtaining marketing approvals will be, or when and if such approvals will be granted, or when actual sales will occur.
research and development
We fund the research and development of our products primarily from cash receipts resulting from the sale of our equity securities and convertible debentures in registered offerings and private placements. Additionally, we have raised capital through other debt financings, the sale of our tax benefits and research products, interest income and financing received from our Chief Executive Officer. As of July 31, 2005, we believe our cash balance is sufficient to fund our operations at least through July 31, 2006 based on our expected level of expenditures in relation to activities in preparing ONCONASE(R) for marketing registrations and other ongoing operations of the Company. However, we will continue to seek additional financing through equity or debt financings and the sale of net operating loss carryforwards but cannot be sure that we will be able to raise capital on favorable terms or at all. We may also obtain additional capital through the exercise of outstanding options and warrants, although we cannot provide any assurance of such exercises or the amount of capital we will receive, if any. If we are unable to raise sufficient capital, our operations will be severely curtailed and our business and financial condition will be adversely affected.

Research and development expense for fiscal 2005 was $5,082,000 compared to $3,353,000 for fiscal 2004, an increase of $1,729,000, or 52%. The increase was primarily due to expenses in connection with preparing our NDA for ONCONASE(R), including the completion of key toxicology requirements and key requirements for chemistry, manufacturing and controls, including the ONCONASE(R) stability program of approximately $1,040,000. This increase also resulted from pre-clinical sponsored research and development expenses; the new Phase II program for non-small cell lung, including consulting fees of approximately $292,000; expansion of the confirmatory Phase IIIb clinical trial in countries outside of the European Union, including the retention of another clinical research organization to assure regulatory compliance in the conduct of the trial in these countries; grant payments; clinical monitoring and data management fees related to our pivotal Phase III clinical trial for malignant mesothelioma of approximately $264,000; increases in patent expenses of approximately $190,000; personnel costs of approximately $71,000 and depreciation expense and equipment repairs and maintenance of approximately $21,000; offset by a decrease in the non-cash expense related to stock options issued for consulting services of approximately $149,000.

Research and development expense for fiscal 2004 was $3,353,000 compared to $1,700,000 for fiscal 2003, an increase of $1,653,000, or 97%. This increase was primarily due to increases in data management, clinical research organization fees and clinical expenses related to our pivotal Phase III clinical trial for malignant mesothelioma of approximately $1,302,000; sponsored research and development expenses of approximately $236,000, consulting costs of approximately $142,000; non cash expense related to stock options issued for consulting services of approximately $94,000; offset by a decrease in personnel and insurance expenses of approximately $121,000.

New Jersey has enacted legislation permitting certain corporations located in New Jersey to sell a portion of its state tax loss carryforwards and state research and development credits in order to obtain tax benefits. For the state fiscal year 2005 (July 1, 2004 to June 30, 2005), we had approximately $1,335,000 total available tax benefits that were saleable; of which New Jersey permitted us to sell approximately $339,000. In December 2004, we received approximately $288,000 from the sale of the $339,000 of tax benefits, which we recognized as tax benefits for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2005.

At July 31, 2005, we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $52,823,000 that expire from 2006 to 2025 (approximately $8,675,000 expires in the years 2006 to 2010). We also had research and experimentation tax credit carryforwards of approximately $1,955,000 that expire from 2006 to 2025 (approximately $152,000 expires in the years 2006 to 2010). New Jersey has enacted legislation permitting certain corporations located in New Jersey to sell a portion of its state tax loss carryforwards and state research and development credits in order to obtain tax benefits. The aggregate amount of tax benefits that New Jersey allows corporations to sell each state fiscal year (July 1st through June 30th) is determined annually and if New Jersey reduces such aggregate amount in any fiscal year we may be unable to sell some or all of our available tax benefits as we have in the past. In addition, there is a limited market for these types of sales and we may not be able to find someone to purchase our tax benefits for a reasonable price. Our historical results of operations have been improved by our sale of tax benefits and if we continue to generate a limited amount of revenue and are unable in the future to sell our tax benefits, our results of operations will be negatively impacted.

Because of the specialized scientific nature of our business, our continued success also is dependent upon our ability to attract and retain qualified management and scientific personnel. There is intense competition for qualified personnel in the pharmaceutical field. As our company grows our inability to attract qualified management and scientific personnel could materially adversely affect our research and development programs, the commercialization of our products and the potential revenue from product sales.

We fund the research and development of our products from cash receipts resulting from the private sales of our securities, sale of our tax benefits and from certain debt financings. Presently, our cash balance is sufficient to fund our operations in the near term, however, we intend to raise additional capital through the sale of our securities and strategic alliance(s). However, there are no assurances that such funds will be obtained.

Research and development expense for fiscal 2003 was $1,700,000 compared to $2,033,000 for fiscal 2002, a decrease of $333,000, or 16.4%. This decrease was primarily due to decreases in personnel costs, regulatory consulting costs and a reduction of non-cash expenses relating to stock options issued for consulting services. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in costs relating to patent and trademark applications for ONCONASE(R).

Since our inception, we have devoted the majority of our resources to the research and development of ONCONASE(R) and related drug candidates. After we obtained the results of our preliminary analysis of the Phase III clinical trial for advanced pancreatic cancer, we closed the pancreatic cancer trials and redirected our resources towards the completion of the clinical program for unresectable malignant mesothelioma.

We have had a series of meetings and communications with the FDA and EMEA to establish mutually agreed upon parameters for the NDA and MAA filings for the malignant mesothelioma indication. In the ongoing Phase III trial in this indication, an interim analysis based on the occurrence of 105 deaths is planned. Based upon the results of these analyses, we may be able to file an NDA and an MAA within six months after the completion of the analyses. Marketing approval for ONCONASE(R) as a treatment for malignant mesothelioma may not be granted by the FDA or EMEA. We are also exploring out-licensing and various strategic alternatives for our business, research and development operations with other companies.

We are currently funding the research and development of our products from cash receipts resulting from the private sales of our securities and from certain debt financings. The termination of the Phase III clinical trials for advanced pancreatic cancer had a significant and detrimental impact on the price of our common stock and our ability to raise additional capital for future operations. We may not have, or may not be able to obtain, the financial resources required to pay for all the associated costs of the malignant mesothelioma program to file in the Unites States and/or foreign registration for the marketing approval of ONCONASE(R) for this indication.

In August 1995, the Company entered into a CRADA with the NCI. In accordance with this CRADA, the NCI performed research for the Company on potential uses for its drug technology. During the term of this research and development agreement, which expired in August 1999, the Company was obligated to pay approximately $5,200 per month to the NCI. In September 1999, this research and development agreement was amended to expire in August 2000 and in June 2000 the expiration was extended to expire in August 2001. Both extensions were without additional cost for the Company. Total research and development expenses under this arrangement amounted to $5,200 for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2000.

Research and development expenses for the fiscal years ended July 31, 2001, 2000, and 1999 were $1,901,000, $1,880,000, and $2,402,000, respectively. Our research and development programs focus primarily on the development of therapeutics from amphibian ribonucleases. Because ribonucleases have been shown to be involved in the regulation of cell proliferation, maturation, differentiation and programmed cell death known as apoptosis, ribonucleases may be ideal candidates for the development of therapeutics for the treatment of cancer and other life-threatening diseases, including HIV infection, that require anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic properties.

Since our inception, we have devoted the majority of our resources to the research and development of ONCONASE(R). After we obtained the results of our preliminary analysis of the Phase III clinical trial results for advanced pancreatic cancer, we closed the pancreatic cancer trials and redirected our resources towards the completion of the ongoing Phase III clinical trial for unresectable malignant mesothelioma. We have had a series of meetings and communications with the FDA and EMEA to establish mutually agreed upon parameters for the NDA/MAA submissions. We must complete the current clinical trial for the FDA filing, as well as provide the FDA and EMEA with information regarding the methods used to manufacture ONCONASE(R), evaluation of the therapeutic and toxic doses of ONCONASE(R) in animals and studies regarding the detection of ONCONASE(R) in human blood and antibody formation. Additionally, for the MAA submission, we must establish or designate a legal partner in the EU, which is considered to be a qualified pharmaceutical company (has qualified individuals) for at least three months prior to filing the MAA. We are also exploring various strategic alternatives for our business and our research and development operations.

We are currently funding the research and development of our products from cash receipts resulting from the private sales of our securities and from certain debt financings. The termination of the Phase III clinical trials for advanced pancreatic cancer had a significant and detrimental impact on the price of our common stock and our ability to raise additional capital for future operations. We may not have, or may not be able to obtain, the financial resources required to pay for all the associated costs of the malignant mesothelioma program to file a Unites States and/or foreign registration for the marketing approval of ONCONASE(R) for this indication.

Research and development expense for fiscal 2001 was $1,901,000 compared to $1,880,000 for fiscal 2000, an increase of $21,000, or 1%. This increase was primarily due to an increase in costs in support of ongoing clinical trials and increase in costs related to ONCONASE(R) clinical supplies, both primarily due to the expansion of our Phase III clinical trials for malignant mesothelioma in Europe. These increases were offset by a decrease in expenses related to the NDA filing for ONCONASE(R) with the FDA.

Research and development expense for fiscal 2000 was $1,880,000 compared to $2,402,000 for fiscal 1999, a decrease of $522,000, or 22%. This decrease was primarily due to an 80% decrease in costs in support of ongoing clinical trials, primarily due to lower clinical costs related to the Phase III clinical trials for malignant mesothelioma

This decrease was primarily due to an 80% decrease in costs in support of ongoing clinical trials, primarily due to lower clinical costs related to the Phase III clinical trials for malignant mesothelioma and pancreatic cancer, an 82% decrease in costs related to the preclinical research studies of ONCONASE(R) and a 44% decrease in costs related to the manufacture of clinical supplies of ONCONASE(R). These decreases were offset by an increase in expenses in preparation of an NDA filing for ONCONASE(R) and an 82% increase in expenses associated with the new patent and trademark applications for ONCONASE(R).

New Jersey has enacted legislation permitting certain corporations located in New Jersey to sell state tax loss carryforwards and state research and development credits or tax benefits. Approximately $2.4 million of our tax benefits were approved for sale by the state in December 1999, of which approximately $1 million was allocated to be sold between July 1, 1999 and June 30, 2000. In December 1999, we received $755,854 from the sale of $1 million of our tax benefits which was recognized as a tax benefit for fiscal year 2000. We will attempt to sell the remaining balance of our tax benefits in the amount of approximately $1.4 million between July 1, 2000 and June 30, 2001, subject to all existing laws of the State of New Jersey. However, we cannot assure you that we will be able to find a buyer for our tax benefits or that such funds will be available in a timely manner.

Development costs for sugarcane are capitalized the same as citrus. However, sugarcane matures in one year and Alico is able to harvest an average of three crops (one per year) from one planting. As a result, cultivation and caretaking costs are expensed as the crop is harvested, while the appropriate development and planting costs are depreciated over three years.

The Company evaluates property, equipment and capitalized development costs for our sugarcane and citrus groves for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of assets contained in the Companys financial statements may not be recoverable. The impairment calculation compares the carrying value of the asset to the assets estimated future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges). If the estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset, the Company calculates an impairment loss. The Company recognizes an impairment loss if the amount of the assets carrying value exceeds the assets estimated fair value. If an impairment loss is recognized, the adjusted carrying amount of the asset will be its new cost basis. For a depreciable long-lived asset, the new cost basis will be depreciated (amortized) over the remaining useful life of that asset. Restoration of a previously recognized impairment loss is prohibited. For further information concerning the impairment charges please refer to Note 1c to the consolidated financial statements.

Description of business. Musical Instruments. Allen Organ Company is a leading manufacturer of electronic keyboard musical instruments, primarily digital church organs and accessories. This segment accounted for 26%, 34% and 37% of net sales in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The principal market for the Musical Instruments segment is institutions, primarily churches. Sales to homes make up a smaller portion of this segment's sales. Musical Instruments are distributed mostly through dealers, primarily independent retail music stores throughout the United States, with a lesser percentage distributed through dealers internationally. The segment's business is not seasonal. The principal raw materials used in the segment's products are electronic components and wood, which are readily available from various sources without undue difficulty. Traditionally, organs have longer service requirements than other digital products. As life cycles for electronic components have shortened in recent years the Company has had to redesign some circuit boards to satisfy the needs of current and past customers. At the present time, management does not expect this issue to significantly affect future product shipments. This segment does not engage in any significant amounts of extended payment terms, or lease guarantees. The Company is contingently liable in connection with certain customers' financing arrangements (see Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). The dollar amounts and number of times the Company has had to honor these repurchase agreements have been negligible. The Musical Instruments segment is not dependent on any single or small group of customers, the loss of which would have a material adverse effect on the business. The dollar amount of the segment's unshipped order backlog at the end of February 2005 and 2004 was $4.9 million and $3.6 million, respectively. All orders are expected to be filled in the current year. The organ industry is competitive involving at least five domestic and foreign manufacturers of digital organs. In addition, there are many small pipe organ companies that serve the institutional organ market. The organ market consists of two basic divisions, institutional (primarily churches) and home or entertainment type instruments. Management believes it is the largest supplier of organs for the institutional market in the United States (largest world market) because of product performance and competitive prices, and has a smaller percentage of the home or entertainment organ market. This segment also markets its organ consoles and control electronics to customers that want to retain their wind-blown pipes and augment them with digital voices. The Company maintains a research and development program to take advantage of the latest in technological developments relating to digital sound generation.

General. The Company's working capital is sufficient to meet the normal expansion of inventory and receivables. The Company spent $13,948,340, $8,785,522 and $7,782,571 in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, on research and development. The 2004 and 2003 increases were mainly within the Data Communications segment. The Company maintains an ongoing commitment to new product development and expects future expenditures for these activities to exceed the 2004 level. 6 General. (Continued) The Company monitors its compliance with applicable federal, state, or local provisions with regard to the environment and implements procedures or modifies its equipment as necessary. The Company does not expect any significant capital additions in the coming year to maintain its compliance. The Company and its subsidiaries employ approximately 505 people. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. Management believes that relations with employees are good.

Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Business Overview: As discussed in Note 21 of the financial statements, Allen Organ Company and Subsidiaries ("Company") operate in four industry segments: Musical Instruments, Data Communications, Electronic Assemblies and Audio Equipment. Sales for the year ended December 31, 2004 increased $19,382,730 when compared to 2003, primarily due to increased sales in the Company's Data Communications segment. Net income increased $3,312,151 during the year ended December 31, 2004, compared to 2003, primarily due to the higher sales in the Data Communications segment and improved operating results in the Musical Instruments segment. Net sales consist of revenues obtained for the sale of electronic keyboard musical instruments in the Musical Instruments segment; data networking products and support services in the Data Communications Segment; electronic assembly services in the Electronic Assemblies segment; and audio speaker cabinets in the Audio Equipment segment. Sales credits and adjustments are also included in net sales. Cost of sales consist primarily of material costs of products sold, salary and benefit costs related to production and manufacturing support personnel, incoming shipping and facility related costs, such as depreciation and maintenance. Consolidated selling, general and administrative expenses and research and development expenses increased approximately $8,197,000 and $1,554,000 during the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively, primarily related to the growth in the Data Communications segment. Selling expenses consist primarily of employee salary and benefit costs, advertising and marketing expenses. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of employee salary and benefit costs, professional services fees and other general corporate expenses. Research and development expenses consist primarily of employee salary and benefit costs for engineering staff, third party contracted development services, product prototyping and compliance costs. 9 Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources: The Company continues to maintain a strong financial position and high level of liquidity, which enables it to generate funds internally to meet operating needs, capital expenditures and short-term obligations. Key indicators of the Company's liquidity are presented below: December 31, 2004 2003 Working Capital $46,943,904 $43,917,002 Current Ratio 5.3 to 1 6.5 to 1 Total Liabilities to Equity Ratio 0.31 to 1 0.28 to 1
research and development
Consolidated research and development expenses increased $5,162,818 during the year ended December 31, 2004 when compared to 2003 primarily related to a $5,292,000 increase in the Data Communications segment. This increase was primarily from salaries and benefits for additional engineering staff, prototype costs and contracted design services associated with the development of the Data Communications segments next generation products. Consolidated research and development expenses increased $1,002,951 during the year ended December 31, 2003, when compared to 2002, primarily related to an $820,000 increase in the Data Communications segment. This increase was made up primarily of salaries and benefits for additional engineering staff. Consolidated costs and expenses for the year ended December 31, 2004 also includes a charge for impairment of goodwill and intangibles of $362,611 related to the write down of the carrying value of Legacy Audio's goodwill and intangibles. Investment income decreased $39,649 and $283,936 during the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively, due to lower rates of return available on invested funds. The minority interest in consolidated subsidiaries represents the ERI employee shareholders interest in the net income of Eastern Research after recovering accumulated losses from prior years that were absorbed by the parent company. There was no minority interest in consolidated subsidiaries in 2003 and 2002, as all consolidated subsidiaries had accumulated losses that had been absorbed by the parent and, in the case of Eastern Research, were being recovered by subsequent net income of the subsidiary. The effective tax rate (benefit) was 22.5%, (5.7%) and 29.3% in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. See Note 16 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for a reconciliation of the income tax provision to the statutory rates. The effective tax rate in 2004, 2003 and 2002 is lower than statutory tax rates primarily due to foreign income with the benefit of lower tax rates, research and development credits and non-taxable investment income derived from investment in municipal bond funds. The 2004 rate increased compared to 2003 primarily due to higher levels of taxable income in 2004 offset by higher levels of tax credits and tax exempt income. The 2003 rate decreased when compared to 2002 due to the low level of taxable income which, after deducting tax credits and exempt income, resulted in a small tax benefit. Consolidated net income increased $3,312,151 during the year ended December 31, 2004, compared to 2003, primarily due to the higher sales and operating income in the Data Communications segment and improved operating results in the Musical Instruments segment. Consolidated net income decreased $1,288,461 during the year ended December 31, 2003, compared to 2002, primarily due to operating losses of $765,000 and $457,000 incurred in the Musical Instruments and Electronic Assemblies segments, respectively. The Company is in the process of implementing regulations contained in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 applicable to companies with a class of securities registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, in particular Section 404 relating to Management's Assessment of Internal Controls. Compliance with these regulations is estimated to cost in the range of $400,000 to $600,000 for initial implementation. These costs will be incurred over 2005 and 2006. In addition, there will be ongoing compliance costs thereafter which management expects will range from $250,000 to $400,000 annually.
research and development
Musical Instruments Segment Domestic sales for 2004 were approximately equal to 2003. The 2004 order rate and backlog on December 31, 2004 continue to be higher than the same periods in 2003 reflecting favorable customer reaction to the Company's Quantum organs that include significant new features and product benefits, as well as an improved economic environment. Quantum organs offer Quad SuiteT and Acoustic PortraitT. Quad Suite allows Quantum organs to supply four complete tonal specifications in one organ console increasing the instrument's versatility. Acoustic Portrait adds low- latency convolution reverberation, currently an exclusive feature for the church organ market. Convolution technology enables the Company to accurately reproduce the response of desired rooms and include them in Quantum organs. The domestic sales for 2003 decreased $4,661,000 from 2002 due to lower order volume, which management believed was caused by the economic downturn, declines in financial markets and general global uncertainty caused by the war in Iraq. 12 Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Musical Instruments Segment (Continued) This segment is seeing changes in the type of music used in churches throughout North America, the primary market for this segment's organs, which may negatively impact future sales volume for this segment. Some churches have changed their music programs from traditional styles that primarily use an organ, to more "contemporary" services where the organ plays a lesser or no role. To address the changing needs of church music, the Company recently introduced products including the Allen EnsembleT that combines traditional organ sounds and more contemporary General MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) sounds. The Company also introduced EACT (Expanded Audio Capabilities) that allows churches that have both traditional and contemporary programs to utilize their Allen organ's audio capabilities for playing back recorded music or amplifying other musical instruments. The introduction of the Allen Ensemble and EAC are intended to help maintain the organ as the cornerstone of church music programs. Export sales increased approximately $577,000 during the year ended December 31, 2004 when compared to 2003, which management believes is attributable to the decreased value of the US dollar compared to certain foreign currencies making the Company's products more affordable in those countries. Export sales were approximately equal in 2003 when compared to 2002. Certain foreign markets continue to be affected by unfavorable economic conditions. Gross profit margins on sales were 27.5%, 21.1% and 29.5% for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The 2004 increase is attributable to the higher sales volume, favorable product mix changes caused by the introduction of Quantum organs and the effect of cost reduction efforts initiated to reduce material and other operating costs. The 2003 decrease in gross profit margins was a result of lower sales volume over which to absorb fixed costs and higher operating costs including employee pension expense, which increased by $597,000 (103%) in 2003 versus 2002. Selling and advertising expenses during 2004 were approximately equal to 2003 and decreased approximately $71,000 during 2003 when compared to 2002, due to lower sales volume. General and administrative expenses increased approximately $108,000 during 2004 when compared to 2003, primarily due to higher fees incurred for professional services including legal and audit services. General and administrative expenses decreased approximately $60,000 in 2003 when compared to 2002. Research and development expenses decreased approximately $152,000 during 2004 compared to 2003 primarily due to lower retirement benefit costs and increased approximately $82,000 during 2003 when compared to 2002. Several of the Company's operating expenses continue to rise at significant rates including business insurances, medical insurance and other employee benefit expenses. As discussed in Note 14 to the financial statements, effective December 31, 2003, the Company froze future benefit accruals in both of its defined benefit pension plans and replaced this benefit with a discretionary contribution to the Allen Organ Company Savings and Profit Sharing Plan. During 2005, management has implemented a profit sharing bonus plan for employees at its Macungie, PA facility which contains its Musical Instrument, Electronic Assemblies and Audio Equipment segments. The Company will contribute 10% of this plants operating income to eligible employees. The plan has been implemented to incent employees to work along with management in lowing costs, improving processes and quality and improving the plants operating results.

Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Data Communications Segment (Continued) Selling expenses increased approximately $2,138,000 (28%) in 2004 when compared to 2003, primarily due to increases in ERI's domestic sales force ($983,000), marketing ($344,000) and higher costs associated with international sales efforts ($621,000). Selling expenses increased approximately $823,000 in 2003 when compared to 2002, due to increases in ERI's sales efforts both domestic and international. Administrative expenses increased approximately $426,000 (15%) in 2004 compared to 2003, and increased approximately $50,000 in 2003 compared to 2002. These increases are primarily due to additional management and administrative personnel to support the segment's growth. Research and development expenses were $12,465,063, $7,173,393 and $6,352,909 for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The 2004 increase is due primarily to additional personnel and related costs associated with the development of the Company's next generation products. The products under development are expected to continue to serve emerging segments of the mobile and fixed network service providers, as well as private networks, and may also present the Company with a much broader market opportunity. The 2003 increase was due to increased expenditures incurred in connection with the July 2003 acquisition of Avail Networks and the commencement of work on next generation products. The segment is committed to new product development and expects these expenditures to increase during 2005. The combination of higher sales and higher gross margins resulted in operating income of $6,436,161, $2,446,213 and $2,091,520 during 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, for this segment. Future sales in this segment have become increasingly dependent on larger sales opportunities that could result in the amount and timing of future revenue and operating income to be more volatile. In addition, this segment will increase future operating costs, primarily research and development to develop next generation products, which is expected to negatively impact future operating results.

Musical Instruments. Allen Organ Company is a leading manufacturer of electronic keyboard musical instruments, primarily digital church organs and accessories. This segment accounted for 34%, 37% and 40% of net sales in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The principal market for the Musical Instruments segment is institutions, primarily churches. Sales to the home market make up a smaller portion of this segment's sales. Musical Instruments are distributed mostly through dealers, primarily independent retail music stores throughout the United States, with a lesser percentage distributed through dealers internationally. The segment's business is not seasonal. The principal raw materials used in the segment's products are electronic components and wood, which are readily available from various sources without undue difficulty. Traditionally, organs have longer service requirements than other digital products. As life cycles for electronic components have shortened in recent years the Company has had to redesign some circuit boards to satisfy the needs of current and past customers. At the present time, management does not expect this issue to significantly affect future product shipments. This segment does not engage in any significant amounts of extended payment terms, or lease guarantees. The Company is contingently liable in connection with certain customers' financing arrangements (see Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). The dollar amounts and number of times the Company has had to honor these repurchase agreements are negligible. The Musical Instruments segment is not dependent on any single or small group of customers, the loss of which would have a material adverse effect on the business. The dollar amount of the segment's unshipped order backlog at the end of February 2004 and 2003 was $3.6 million and $4.2 million, respectively. All orders are expected to be filled in the current year. The organ industry is competitive involving at least five (5) domestic and foreign companies manufacturing digital organs. In addition, there are many small pipe organ companies that serve the institutional organ market. The organ market consists of two basic divisions, institutional (primarily churches) and home or entertainment. Management believes it is the largest supplier of organs for the institutional market in the United States (largest world market) because of product performance and competitive prices, and a smaller percentage of the home or entertainment organ market. This segment also markets its organ consoles and control electronics to customers that want to retain their wind-blown pipes and augment them with digital voices. Allen Organ Company maintains an aggressive research and development program to take advantage of the latest in technological developments relating to digital sound generation.

General. The Company's working capital is sufficient to meet the normal expansion of inventory and receivables. The Company spent $8,785,522, $7,782,571 and $8,004,838 in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively, on research and development. The 2003 increase was mainly within the Data Communications segment. The Company maintains an ongoing commitment to new product development and expects future expenditures for these activities to exceed the 2003 level. The Company and its subsidiaries employ approximately 450 people. The Company monitors its compliance with applicable federal, state, or local provisions with regard to the environment and implements procedures or modifies its equipment as necessary. The Company does not expect any significant capital additions in the coming year to maintain its compliance.

Musical Instruments Segment The domestic sales for 2003 decreased $4,660,699. The 2003 decrease in domestic sales was the result of lower order volume, which management believes was caused by the economic downturn, declines in financial markets and general global uncertainty caused by the war in Iraq. While the order rate for 2002 was slightly lower than 2001, the 2002 sales were higher than 2001 due to shipments made to customers against a higher order backlog. Export sales were approximately equal in 2003 and 2002, and decreased in 2002, as compared to the previous year. Certain foreign markets continue to be affected by unfavorable economic conditions. While the value of the US dollar compared to certain foreign currencies has decreased, there is a time lag before any such change can impact export sales. Gross profit margins on sales were 21.1%, 29.5% and 30.1% for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The 2003 decrease was a result of lower sales volume over which to absorb fixed costs and higher operating costs including employee pension expense, which increased by $597,000 (103%) in 2003 versus 2002. The decrease in gross profit in 2002, when compared to 2001, was due to higher operating costs, primarily employee pension expense and lower absorption of fixed costs related to planned decreases in the level of inventory necessitating lower levels of production. The Company has taken steps to reduce its operating costs at the Macungie, PA plant, including reductions in personnel. Selling and advertising expenses decreased approximately $71,000 during 2003 when compared to 2002, due to lower sales volume and was approximately equal in 2002 and 2001. General and administrative expenses decreased approximately $60,000 in 2003 when compared to 2002, and increased approximately $38,000 in 2002 when compared to 2001. Research and development expenses increased approximately $82,000 during 2003 when compared to 2002, and decreased approximately $29,000 in 2002 from 2001. Several of the Company's operating expenses continue to rise at significant rates including business insurances, medical insurance and pension expense. The Company's pension expense has increased due to lower investment returns realized in the Company's defined benefit pension plans. As discussed in Note 16 to the financial statements, effective December 31, 2003 the Company has frozen future benefit accruals in both of its defined benefit pension plans and replaced this benefit with a discretionary contribution to the Allen Organ Company Savings and Profit Sharing Plan.

Data Communications Segment Domestic sales increased $3,145,416 and $3,539,977 in 2003 and 2002, respectively. International sales decreased $3,659,334 in 2003 when compared to 2002 and increased $7,086,312 in 2002 when compared to 2001. International sales in 2002 were higher than both 2003 and 2001 due primarily from sales made to one customer. The total 2003 sales were approximately equal to 2002, which increased over 2001 due to new product introductions and from redirecting the Company's sales and marketing efforts away from CLEC's to other Data Communications markets, including the wireless, enterprise, government and certain international markets. Gross profit margins were 56%, 50% and 40% in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The 2003 increase is due to favorable product mix changes and was lowered by an $850,000 accrual for warranty costs. The 2002 increase is attributable to higher sales volume over which to absorb fixed costs, as well as changes in product mix. Cost of goods sold for 2001 includes $1,539,000 of additional non-cash inventory valuation adjustments recorded at VIR, Inc. for slow moving and obsolete inventory associated with discontinued product lines. The result of these adjustments was to decrease the 2001 gross profit margin by 6% from 46% to 40%. While the Company strives to maintain profit margins by developing products that offer desirable features, the industry is very competitive which often results in pricing changes to obtain and maintain market share. Selling expenses increased approximately $823,000 in 2003 when compared to 2002 due to increases in ERI's sales force and higher costs associated with international sales efforts. Selling expenses decreased approximately $654,000 in 2002 compared to 2001 due to cost cutting measures initiated in the first half of 2001 due to the economic downturn. Administrative expenses increased approximately $50,000 in 2003 compared to 2002, and decreased approximately $21,000 in 2002 compared to 2001. Research and development expenses were $7,173,393, $6,352,909 and $6,599,104 for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The 2003 increase was due to increased expenditures incurred in connection with the acquisition of Avail Networks and the commencement of work on next generation products. The 2002 decrease is primarily due to the combination of the VIR development operations into ERI during the second half of 2001. The segment is committed to new product development and expects these expenditures to increase during 2004. The combination of higher sales, change in product mix, and higher gross margins resulted in operating income of $2,474,257 and $2,105,802 during 2003 and 2002, respectively, for this segment compared to an operating loss of $8,284,232 in 2001. The 2001 operating loss was negatively affected by inventory valuation adjustments, plant closing costs, and a charge to write down the goodwill and intangible assets of VIR totaling $3,469,000. Future sales in this segment have become increasingly dependent on larger sales opportunities that could result in the amount and timing of future revenue and operating income to be more volatile.

The domestic sales for 2002 increased $1,077,932. While the order rate for 2002 was slightly lower than 2001, the 2002 sales were higher due to shipments made to customers against a higher order backlog. The 2001 decrease in domestic sales was the result of shipments in 2000 made against a higher order backlog. As discussed on page 3, the economic downturn may affect future order volume. Export sales were lower in 2002, as compared to the previous year, and approximately equal in 2001 and 2000. Certain foreign markets continue to be affected by unfavorable economic conditions. While the value of the US dollar compared to certain foreign currencies has decreased, there is a time lag before any such change can have an impact on export sales. In recent years the Company has entered a different subset of the organ market that includes the sale of its organ consoles and control electronics to customers that want to retain their wind-blown pipes. In the past, this market was served by pipe organ manufacturers and local pipe organ maintenance organizations. The Company's ability to produce both the wood cabinetry and digital electronics gives it an advantage in this market. Gross profit margins on sales were 29.5%, 30.1% and 36.5% for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The 2002 decrease was due to higher operating costs, primarily employee pension expense and lower absorption of fixed costs related to planned decreases in the level of inventory necessitating slightly lower levels of production. The decrease in gross profit in 2001, when compared to 2000, was a result of lower sales volume over which to absorb fixed costs and changes in product mix. Selling and advertising expenses remained relatively constant in 2002, 2001 and 2000. General and administrative expenses increased approximately $38,000 in 2002 when compared to 2001, which was approximately equal to 2000. Research and development expenses decreased approximately $29,000 in 2002 from 2001 and decreased approximately $25,000 in 2001 from 2000. Several of the Company's operating expenses continue to rise at significant rates including business insurances, medial insurance and pension expense. The Company's pension expense has increased due to lower investment returns realized in the Company's defined benefit pension plans. The Company has reduced its long-term rate of return assumption in both of its defined benefit pension plans due to lower projected future investment returns and expects that pension related costs will increase in future years.

Domestic sales increased $3,539,977 in 2002, compared to the previous year, and decreased $2,989,447 in 2001 when compared to 2000. International sales increased $7,086,312 in 2002, compared to the previous year, and decreased $4,422,010 during 2001 when compared to 2000. The increase in international sales in 2002 was primarily from sales to one customer. The 2002 sales increased due to new product introductions and from redirecting the Company's sales and marketing efforts away from CLEC's to other Data Communications markets, for which its product line is well suited, including the wireless, enterprise, government and certain international markets. The 2001 sales decreased from 2000 due to a general slowdown in the world economy and a more significant industry-wide slowdown in Data Communications markets. Some of this segment's products had been sold to CLEC's, many of which had difficulty raising capital and became insolvent. Gross profit margins were 50%, 40% and 47% in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The 2002 increase is attributable to higher sales volume over which to absorb fixed costs and changes in product mix. Cost of goods sold for 2001 includes $1,539,000 of additional non-cash inventory valuation adjustments recorded at VIR, Inc. for slow moving and obsolete inventory associated with discontinued product lines. The result of these adjustments was to decrease the 2001 gross profit margin by 6% from 46% to 40%. The decrease in the 2001 gross profit margin from 2000, excluding the inventory valuation adjustments, was due to lower sales volume over which to absorb fixed costs and competitive pressures to lower selling prices of products. While the Company strives to maintain profit margins by developing products that offer desirable features, the industry is very competitive which often results in pricing changes to obtain and maintain market share. Selling expenses decreased approximately $654,000 in 2002 compared to 2001, and decreased approximately $1,123,000 in 2001 from 2000. These decreases are related to cost cutting measures initiated in the first half of 2001 due to the economic downturn. In addition, 2001 expenses decreased due to lower sales in 2001. Administrative expenses decreased approximately $21,000 in 2002 compared to 2001, and decreased approximately $347,000 in 2001 compared to 2000, from cost cutting measures initiated in the first half of 2001 due to the economic downturn. Research and development expenses were $6,352,909, $6,599,104 and $5,911,740 for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The 2002 decrease is primarily due to the combination of the VIR operations into ERI during the second half of 2001. The segment is committed to new product development and expects these expenditures to continue at approximately the same level in 2003. The combination of increased sales, higher gross margins and lower operating costs resulted in operating income of $2,105,802 during 2002 for this segment compared to an operating loss of $8,284,232 in 2001. The 2001 operating loss was negatively affected by inventory valuation adjustments, plant closing costs, and a charge to write down the goodwill and intangible assets of VIR totaling $3,469,000. Future sales visibility remains limited throughout the Data Communications market that ERI serves with many companies that buy equipment continuing to lower their capital expenditures for such equipment. These factors, along with continued uncertainty in completing sales to larger accounts, create significant uncertainty of operating results in future quarters.

As a result of the foregoing or other factors, there can be no assurance that the Company will not experience material fluctuations in future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis, which would materially and adversely affect the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.

The Company's working capital is sufficient to meet the normal expansion of inventory and receivables. The Company spent $8,004,838, $7,340,209, and $4,910,278 annually in 2001, 2000, and 1999 respectively on research and development. The increases are a result of the Company's ongoing commitment to new product development and support, primarily in its Data Communications segment. The Company and its subsidiaries employ approximately 510 persons. The Company monitors its compliance with applicable federal, state, or local provisions with regard to the environment and implements procedures or modifies its equipment as necessary. The Company does not expect any significant capital additions in the coming year to maintain its compliance.

The domestic sales for 2001 decreased $3,806,000. While the order rate for 2001 was approximately equal to orders for 2000, the 2000 sales were higher due to shipments made to domestic customers against a higher order backlog. The 2000 increase in domestic sales reflects increased order volume and shipments made against a higher order backlog. As discussed on page 3, the economic downturn may affect future order volume. Export sales were approximately equal for the three years ended December 31, 2001. Certain foreign markets continue to be affected by unfavorable economic conditions, particularly Far East countries, and changes in the value of the US dollar compared to foreign currencies. In recent years the Company has entered a different subset of the institutional organ market that includes the sale of its organ consoles and control electronics to customers that want to retain their wind-blown pipes. In the past this market was served by pipe organ manufacturers and local pipe organ maintenance organizations. The Company's ability to produce both the wood cabinetry and digital electronics gives it an advantage in this market. Gross profit margins on sales were 30.1%, 36.5% and 30.5% for the three years ended December 31, 2001. The 2001 decrease is due to lower sales over which to absorb fixed costs and changes in product mix. The increase in gross profit in 2000 over 1999 was a result of higher sales volume over which to absorb fixed costs. Selling and advertising expenses remained approximately equal for the three years ended December 31, 2001. General and administrative expenses in 2001 were approximately equal to 2000 and decreased in 2000 due to lower personnel requirements and related benefits. Research and development expenses decreased approximately $25,000 in 2001 and increased approximately $264,000 in 2000.

Domestic sales decreased $2,989,447 in 2001 and increased $3,406,903 in 2000 when compared to 1999. International sales decrease $4,422,010 in 2001 and increased $6,618,460 during 2000. The increase in international sales in 2000 was primarily from sales to two customers in the Far East. The decrease in 2001 sales is attributable to a general slowdown in the world economy and a more significant industry-wide slowdown in Data Communications markets. Some of this segment's products had been sold to Competitive Local Exchange Carriers (CLEC), many of which had difficulty raising capital and became insolvent. This segment has since redirected its sales efforts away from CLEC's and has focused on other markets for which its product line is well suited including the wireless and certain international markets. As a result, this segment was successful in increasing its order rate during the second half of 2001 to be near the sales level of the same period in 2000. Cost of goods sold for 2001 includes $1,539,000 of additional non-cash inventory valuation adjustments recorded at VIR, Inc. for slow moving and obsolete inventory associated with discontinued product lines. The result of these adjustments was to decrease the 2001 gross profit margin by 6% from 46% to 40%. The decrease in the 2001 gross profit margin, excluding the inventory valuation adjustments, was due to lower sales volume over which to absorb fixed costs and competitive pressures to lower selling prices of products. Gross profit margins were 47% and 48% for 2000 and 1999, respectively. While the company strives to maintain profit margins by developing products that offer more features, the industry is competitive which often results in pricing changes to obtain and maintain market share. Selling expenses decreased approximately $1,123,000 in 2001 and increased approximately $2,500,000 in 2000 over 1999. The 2001 decrease is related to lower sales and cost cutting measures initiated in the first half of 2001 due to the economic downturn. Administrative expenses decreased approximately $347,000 in 2001 from cost cutting measures initiated in the first half of 2001 due to the economic downturn. Administrative expenses increased approximately $900,000 in 2000 over 1999 primarily related to additional management and administrative personnel added at ERI to support its growth. Research and development expenses were $6,599,104, $5,911,740 and $3,759,183 for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively primarily related to ERI. The segment is committed to new product development and support and expects these expenditures to continue at approximately the same level in 2002.

The foreign effective tax rate was 17.0 percent, a decrease of approximately 4.1 percentage points which primarily consisted of a 10.0 percent impact related to a decrease in tax reserves, partially offset by a 5.2 percent impact from increased valuation allowances on net operating losses primarily due to a decrease in Luxembourg and France earnings available to be offset by net operating loss carry forwards and a 1.4 percent impact from tax expense related to foreign exchange. The effective tax rate was lower than the U.S. statutory rate of 35 percent primarily due to overall foreign earnings taxed at lower rates.

The decrease in R&D expense in 2009 compared to 2008 of 14 percent was consistent with our 15 percent decrease in net sales. R&D as a percentage of sales was 4.4, 4.3 and 4.2 percent in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Customer-sponsored (principally the U.S. Government) R&D activities amounted to an additional $874, $852 and $903 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

The sales and margins of each of our segments are directly impacted by government regulations. Safety and performance regulations (including mandates of the Federal Aviation Administration and other similar international regulatory bodies requiring the installation of equipment on aircraft), product certification requirements and government procurement practices can impact Aerospace sales, research and development expenditures, operating costs and profitability. The demand for and cost of providing Automation and Control Solutions products, services and solutions can be impacted by fire, security, safety, health care, environmental and energy efficiency standards and regulations. Specialty Materials results of operations can be affected by environmental (e.g. government regulation of fluorocarbons), safety and energy efficiency standards and regulations, while emissions and energy efficiency standards and regulations can impact the demand for turbochargers in our Transportation Systems segment. Legislation or regulations regarding areas such as labor and employment, employee benefit plans, tax, health, safety and environmental matters, import, export and trade, intellectual property, product certification, and product liability may impact the results of each of our operating segments and our consolidated results.

We are subject to active competition in substantially all product and service areas. Competition is expected to continue in all geographic regions. Competitive conditions vary widely among the thousands of products and services provided by us, and vary by country. Depending on the particular customer or market involved, our businesses compete on a variety of factors, such as price, quality, reliability, delivery, customer service, performance, applied technology, product innovation and product recognition. Brand identity, service to customers and quality are generally important competitive factors for our products and services, and there is considerable price competition. Other competitive factors for certain products include breadth of product line, research and development efforts and technical and managerial capability. While our competitive position varies among our products and services, we believe we are a significant competitor in each of our major product and service classes. However, a number of our products and services are sold in competition with those of a large number of other companies, some of which have substantial financial resources and significant technological capabilities. In addition, some of our products compete with the captive component divisions of original equipment manufacturers. See Item 1A Risk Factors for further discussion.

We are engaged in manufacturing, sales, service and research and development mainly in the United States, Europe, Canada, Asia and Latin America. U.S. exports and foreign manufactured products are significant to our operations. U.S. exports comprised 12, 10 and 10 percent of our total sales in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

However, as a percentage of sales, R&D increased to 4.3 percent in 2009 compared to 4.2 percent in 2008. The increase as a percentage of sales was driven by lower sales, product, design and development costs in Automation and Control Solutions and Specialty Materials as well as expenditures on the development of turbocharging systems for new platforms, partially offset by lower R&D expense in Aerospace primarily due to major program completions. The increase in R&D expense in 2008 compared to 2007 of 6 percent was mainly due to additional product, design and development costs in Automation and Control Solutions, increased expenditures on the development of products for new aircraft platforms and increased expenditures on the development of turbocharging systems for new platforms.

The effective tax rate decreased by 6.2 percentage points in 2006 compared with 2005, due principally to the absence of the 2005 one-time tax charge of $155 million for the repatriation of foreign earnings under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, offset, in part, by $64 million of tax benefits associated with the 2005 sale of our Industrial Wax business which had a higher tax basis than book basis. In addition, in 2006, there were benefits recognized from the favorable resolution of certain tax audits offset by a tax charge for an up-front licensing of certain in-process research and development. The effective tax rate was lower than the statutory rate of 35 percent due in part to tax benefits derived from export sales, lower foreign taxes, and benefits from tax planning strategies.

The Company's effective tax rate decreased by 6.2 percentage points in 2006 compared with 2005, due principally to the absence of the 2005 one-time tax charge of $155 million for the repatriation of foreign earnings under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the “Act”), offset, in part, by $64 million of tax benefits associated with the 2005 sale of our Industrial Wax business which had a higher tax basis than book basis. In addition, in 2006, there were benefits recognized from the favorable resolution of certain tax audits offset by a tax charge for an up-front licensing of certain in-process research and development.

We are subject to active competition in substantially all product and service areas. Competition is expected to continue in all geographic regions. Competitive conditions vary widely among the thousands of products and services provided by us, and vary country by country. Depending on the particular customer or market involved, our businesses compete on a variety of factors, such as price, quality, reliability, delivery, customer service, performance, applied technology, product innovation and product recognition. Brand identity, service to customers and quality are generally important competitive factors for our products and services, and there is considerable price competition. Other competitive factors for certain products include breadth of product line, research and development efforts and technical and managerial capability. While our competitive position varies among our products and services, we believe we are a significant competitor in each of our major product and service classes. However, a number of our products and services are sold in competition with those of a large number of other companies, some of which have substantial financial resources and significant technological capabilities. In addition, some of our products compete with the captive component divisions of original equipment manufacturers.
research and development
We are engaged in manufacturing, sales, service and research and development mainly in the United States, Europe, Canada, Asia and Latin America. U.S. exports and foreign manufactured products are significant to our operations. U.S. exports comprised 10 and 9 percent of our total net sales in 2005 and 2004, respectively. Foreign manufactured products and services, mainly in Europe, were 35 percent of our total net sales in both 2005 and 2004.

Research and development expense totaled $1,072, $917 and $751 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The increase in research and development expense in 2004 compared with 2003 resulted primarily from design and developments costs associated with new aircraft platforms in Aerospace and new product development costs in Automation and Control Solutions. Customer-sponsored (principally the U.S. Government) research and development activities amounted to an additional $694, $593 and $608 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

The sales and margins of each of our segments are directly impacted by government regulations. Safety and performance regulations (including mandates of the Federal Aviation Administration and other similar international regulatory bodies requiring the installation of equipment on aircraft), product certification requirements and government procurement practices can impact Aerospace sales, research and development expenditures, operating costs and profitability. The demand for and cost of providing Automation and Control Solutions products, services and solutions can be impacted by fire, security, safety, health care and energy efficiency standards and regulations. Specialty Materials' results of operations can be affected by environmental (e.g., government regulation of refrigerants), safety and energy efficiency standards and regulations, while emissions and energy efficiency standards and regulations can impact the demand for turbochargers in our Transportation Systems segment.

Gross margin decreased in 2004 by 1.5 percentage points compared with 2003. The decrease resulted primarily from an increase in net repositioning and other charges of $349 million, higher pension and other postretirement benefits expense of $249 million and an increase in research and development expense of $166 million, partially offset by an increase in sales of higher-margin products and services, mainly in our Aerospace reportable segment. Gross margin increased in 2003 by 0.2 percentage points compared with 2002. The increase resulted primarily from a decrease in net repositioning and other charges of $289 million partially offset by higher pension expense and a decrease in sales of higher-margin products and services, mainly in our Aerospace and Automation and Control Solutions reportable segments.

Automation and Control Solutions segment profit in 2004 increased by 6 percent compared with 2003 due to the favorable effect of higher sales volumes partially offset by increased investments in sales and marketing initiatives and higher research and development costs to support new product introductions. Automation and Control Solutions segment profit in 2003 decreased by 2 percent compared with 2002 due mainly to the decline in higher-margin energy-retrofit and discretionary spot sales in our Building Solutions business, and increased research and development expense and investments in sales and marketing initiatives, mainly in our Automation and Control Products and Building Solutions businesses, respectively. Segment profit was also adversely impacted in 2003 by pricing pressures mainly in our Automation and Control Products and Process Solutions businesses.

In December 2003, Alltel sold to Convergys Information Management Group (“Convergys”) for $37.0 million in cash certain assets and related liabilities, including selected customer contracts and capitalized software development costs, associated with the Company’s telecommunications information services operations.
development cost
Cash outlays for the acquisition of property, plant and equipment and for the purchase or development of internal use software continued to be Alltel’s primary use of capital resources. Capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment were $192.3 million for the period November 16, 2007 to December 31, 2007, $860.6 million for the period January 1, 2007 to November 15, 2007 and $1,164.5 million and $949.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Capital expenditures in each of the past three years were incurred to construct additional network facilities and to deploy 1xRTT data and 1x-EVDO technology. During 2007, Alltel continued 1xRTT data deployments in its markets and attained total coverage of approximately 96 percent of its POPs by the end of the year. In addition, the Company expanded its 1x-EVDO coverage into approximately 76 percent of its POPs by the end of 2007. Capital expenditures for 2005 also included incremental spending by Alltel to deploy CDMA technology in the properties acquired from AT&T, as previously discussed. During each of the past three years, Alltel funded substantially all of its capital expenditures through internally generated funds. Investing activities also included outlays for capitalized software development costs, which were $4.2 million for the period November 16, 2007 to December 31, 2007, $29.1 million for the period January 1, 2007 to November 15, 2007 and $32.6 million and $43.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Including capitalized software development costs, outlays for capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $950.0 million to $1,050.0 million for 2008 and will be funded primarily from internally generated funds. Capital expenditures in 2008 will be primarily incurred for further deployment of digital wireless technology, including high-speed wireless data capabilities, in the Company’s existing markets. The forecasted spending levels in 2008 are subject to revision depending on changes in future capital requirements of the Company’s business.
development cost
Net income for 2003 included pretax charges of $1.4 million primarily related to the closing of certain call center locations and the write-off of $7.7 million of certain capitalized software development costs with no alternative future use or functionality. Alltel also recorded a $2.3 million reduction in the liabilities associated with various restructuring activities initiated prior to 2003 to reflect differences between estimated and actual costs paid in completing the previous planned restructuring activities. These transactions decreased net income $4.1 million. Net income for 2003 also included pretax write-downs totaling $6.0 million to reflect other-than-temporary declines in the fair value of certain investments in unconsolidated limited partnerships. These write-downs decreased net income $3.9 million

development cost
In December 2003, Alltel sold to Convergys Information Management Group (“Convergys”) for $37.0 million in cash certain assets and related liabilities, including selected customer contracts and capitalized software development costs, associated with the Company’s telecommunications information services operations.
development cost
Following the sale of certain assets and related liabilities, including selected customer contracts and capitalized software development costs to Convergys in December 2003 and the loss of one of its remaining unaffiliated wireline services customers in 2004, the Company’s telecommunications information services operations consist solely of providing data processing and outsourcing services to Valor. These remaining telecommunications information services operations are not significant to Alltel’s consolidated results of operations.
development cost
During 2003, the Company recorded restructuring and other charges of $8.5 million in connection with the restructuring of the Company’s call center operations. The Company also recorded a $2.7 million reduction in the liabilities associated with various restructuring activities initiated prior to 2003, and Alltel also wrote off $13.2 million of capitalized software development costs that had no alternative future use or functionality.
development cost
Includes cash outlays of $13.1 million for expenses paid in 2003 and non-cash charges of $15.2 million, primarily consisting of the write-off of capitalized computer software development costs discussed in Note (G).
development cost
The above increases in service revenues in both 2005 and 2004 were partially offset by lower wireless airtime and retail roaming revenues, decreases in wireline access and toll service revenues and reductions in revenues derived from telecommunications information services. Compared to the prior year periods, wireless airtime and retail roaming revenues decreased $66.3 million in 2005 and $122.2 million in 2004, primarily due to the effects of customers migrating to rate plans with a larger number of packaged minutes. Such rate plans, for a flat monthly service fee, provide customers with a specified number of airtime minutes and include unlimited weekend, nighttime and mobile-to-mobile minutes at no extra charge. Wireline local service and network access and long-distance revenues decreased $78.8 million in 2005, primarily as a result of the loss of wireline access lines due, in part, to broadband and wireless substitution. Wireline local service and network access and toll revenues decreased $51.4 million in 2004, primarily as a result of the loss of wireline access lines and a $20.3 million reduction in high-cost funding received by Alltel’s wireline subsidiaries under the USF program. Telecommunications information services revenues decreased $24.6 million in 2005 from 2004 due to the loss of one of Alltel’s remaining unaffiliated wireline services customers during the fourth quarter of 2004. Telecommunications information services revenues decreased $67.1 million in 2004 compared to 2003, primarily due to the December 2003 sale of certain assets and related liabilities, including selected customer contracts and capitalized software development costs, to Convergys Information Management Group, Inc. (“Convergys”), as well as the loss of one of Alltel’s remaining unaffiliated customers previously discussed. Service revenue growth in 2004 was also adversely affected by reductions in wireless wholesale revenues and revenues from long-distance and network management services. Wholesale wireless revenues declined $15.1 million in 2004 compared to 2003 primarily due to lower analog and TDMA minutes of use by other carriers’ customers roaming on Alltel’s wireless network, partially offset by growth in CDMA minutes of use as other CDMA carriers directed wholesale traffic to Alltel’s network. Revenues from long-distance and network management services decreased $15.2 million in 2004, primarily due to declining usage by residential customers and a reduction in intercompany and residential customer billing rates.
development cost
Write-down of software development costs
development cost
During 2003, the Company recorded a restructuring charge of $8.5 million consisting of severance and employee benefit costs related to a planned workforce reduction, primarily resulting from the closing of certain call center locations. As of December 31, 2004, Alltel had paid $8.5 million in severance and employee-related expenses, and all of the employee reductions had been completed. Alltel also recorded a $2.7 million reduction in the liabilities associated with various restructuring activities initiated prior to 2003, consisting of $2.2 million in severance and employee benefit costs and $0.5 million in lease termination costs. The reduction primarily reflected differences between estimated and actual costs paid in completing the previous planned workforce reductions and lease terminations. In 2003, Alltel also wrote off certain capitalized software development costs that had no alternative future use or functionality.
development cost
In 2003, Alltel sold to Convergys certain assets and related liabilities, including selected customer contracts and capitalized software development costs, associated with the Company’s telecommunications information services operations. In connection with this sale, the Company received proceeds of $37.0 million and recorded a pretax gain of $31.0 million. Alltel also recorded pretax write-downs totaling $6.0 million to reflect other-than-temporary declines in the fair value of certain investments in unconsolidated limited partnerships. As noted above, during the second quarter of 2003, Alltel retired, prior to stated maturity dates, $249.1 million of long-term debt. In connection with the early retirement of this debt, the Company incurred pretax termination fees of $7.1 million. These transactions increased net income $10.7 million in 2003.
development cost
The decrease in revenues and sales in 2004 reflected declines in long-distance and network management services and telecommunications information services, partially offset by an increase in sales of telecommunications equipment and data products and directory publishing revenues. Revenues attributable to long-distance and network management services declined $15.2 million in 2004. Although the number of long-distance customers served increased during 2004, revenues derived from external customers decreased $10.7 million from 2003, primarily due to declining usage by residential customers and a reduction in customer billing rates due to competition. Revenues earned from affiliates for network management services also decreased $4.5 million in 2004, primarily due to a reduction in intercompany billing rates which took effect April 1, 2004. Telecommunications information services revenues decreased $67.1 million in 2004, primarily due to the December 2003 sale of certain assets and related liabilities, including selected customer contracts and capitalized software development costs, to Convergys, and the loss of one of Alltel’s remaining unaffiliated wireline services customers. The customer contracts sold to Convergys represented approximately 48 percent of the total revenues and sales reported by the telecommunications information services operations in 2003.
development cost
Capital expenditures continued to be Alltel’s primary use of capital resources. Capital expenditures were $1,302.4 million in 2005, $1,125.4 million in 2004 and $1,137.7 million in 2003. Capital expenditures in each of the past three years were incurred to construct additional network facilities, to deploy digital technology in the Company’s existing and acquired wireless markets and to upgrade Alltel’s telecommunications network in order to offer other communications services, including long-distance, Internet, DSL and “Touch-2-Talk” communications services. Capital expenditures for 2005 also included incremental spending by Alltel to deploy CDMA technology in the properties acquired from Cingular as previously discussed. In addition, capital expenditures for 2005 and 2004 also included the Company’s investment in wireless EV-DO technology. Through December 31, 2005, Alltel had launched EV-DO service in twelve markets. During each of the past three years, Alltel funded substantially all of its capital expenditures through internally generated funds. As indicated in the table above under “Segment Capital Requirements”, Alltel expects capital expenditures to be approximately $1,347.5 million to $1,467.5 million for 2006, which will be funded primarily from internally generated funds. Investing activities also included outlays for capitalized software development costs, which were $47.2 million in 2005, $32.3 million in 2004 and $56.7 million in 2003. As indicated in the table above under “Segment Capital Requirements”, Alltel expects expenditures for capitalized software development to be approximately $42.5 million for 2006, which also will be funded from internally generated funds.
development cost
Net income for 2003 included pretax charges of $8.5 million primarily related to the closing of certain call center locations and the write-off of $13.2 million of certain capitalized software development costs with no alternative future use or functionality. The Company also recorded a $2.7 million reduction in the liabilities associated with various restructuring activities initiated prior to 2003 to reflect differences between estimated and actual costs paid in completing the previous planned restructuring activities. These transactions decreased net income $11.5 million or $.04 per share. (See Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements.) Net income for 2003 also included a pretax gain of $31.0 million realized from the sale of certain assets of the telecommunications information services operations, partially offset by pretax write-downs totaling $6.0 million to reflect other-than-temporary declines in the fair value of certain investments in unconsolidated limited partnerships. In addition, Alltel incurred pretax termination fees of $7.1 million related to the early retirement of long-term debt. These transactions increased net income $10.7 million or $.04 per share. (See Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements.) Effective January 1, 2003, Alltel adopted SFAS No. 143 in accounting for asset retirement obligations. The cumulative effect of this accounting change resulted in a one-time non-cash credit of $15.6 million, net of income tax expense of $10.3 million, or $.05 per share. (See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.)

Other plant consists of furniture, fixtures, vehicles, machinery and equipment. The costs of additions, replacements and substantial improvements, including related labor costs, are capitalized, while the costs of maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. For Alltel’s non-regulated operations, when depreciable plant is retired or otherwise disposed of, the related cost and accumulated depreciation are deducted from the plant accounts, with the corresponding gain or loss reflected in operating results. The Company’s wireline subsidiaries utilize group composite depreciation. Under this method, when plant is retired, the original cost, net of salvage value, is charged against accumulated depreciation, and no gain or loss is recognized on the disposition of the plant. Depreciation expense amounted to $1,370.0 million in 2005, $1,239.0 million in 2004 and $1,187.4 million in 2003.

benefit costs and $0.5 million in lease termination costs. The reduction primarily reflected differences between estimated and actual costs paid in completing the previous planned workforce reductions and lease terminations. During the second quarter of 2003, Alltel also wrote off certain capitalized software development costs that had no alternative future use or functionality.

In December 2003, the Company sold to Convergys Information Management Group, Inc. (“Convergys”) certain assets and related liabilities, including selected customer contracts and capitalized software development costs, associated with the Company’s telecommunications information services operations. In connection with this sale, the Company recorded a pretax gain of $31.0 million. In the second quarter of 2003, Alltel recorded pretax write-downs totaling $6.0 million to reflect other-than-temporary declines in the fair value of certain investments in unconsolidated limited partnerships. In addition, during the second quarter of 2003, the Company retired, prior to stated maturity dates, $249.1 million of long-term debt, representing all of the long-term debt outstanding under the Rural Utilities Services, Rural Telephone Bank and Federal Financing Bank programs. In connection with the early retirement of the debt, the Company incurred pretax termination fees of $7.1 million. These transactions increased net income $10.7 million.

In December 2003, ALLTEL sold to Convergys Information Management Group (''Convergys'') for $37.0 million in cash certain assets and related liabilities, including selected customer contracts and capitalized software development costs, associated with the Company's telecommunications information services operations.
development cost
As previously discussed, in December 2003, the Company sold to Convergys certain assets and related liabilities, including selected customer contracts and capitalized software development costs. The sold customer contracts represented approximately 48 percent of the total revenues and sales reported by the telecommunications information services operations in 2003. During 2004, the Company also lost one of its remaining unaffiliated wireline services customers. The remaining telecommunications information services operations are not significant to ALLTEL's consolidated results of operations.
development cost
During 2003, the Company recorded restructuring and other charges of $8.5 million in connection with the restructuring of the Company's call center operations. The Company also recorded a $2.7 million reduction in the liabilities associated with various restructuring activities initiated prior to 2003, and ALLTEL also wrote off $13.2 million of capitalized software development costs that had no alternative future use or functionality.
development cost
Includes cash outlays of $13.1 million for expenses paid in 2003 and non-cash charges of $15.2 million, primarily consisting of the write-off of capitalized computer software development costs discussed in Note (D).
development cost
The above increases in service revenues in 2004 were partially offset by lower wireless airtime, retail roaming and wholesale revenues, reductions in revenues derived from telecommunications information services and decreases in wireline access and toll service revenues. Compared to 2003, wireless airtime and retail roaming revenues decreased $122.2 million in 2004, primarily due to the effects of customers migrating to rate plans with a larger number of packaged minutes. For a flat monthly service fee, such rate plans provide customers with a specified number of airtime minutes and include unlimited weekend, nighttime and mobile-to-mobile minutes at no extra charge. Wholesale wireless revenues declined $15.1 million in 2004 compared to 2003 primarily due to lower analog and TDMA minutes of use by other carriers' customers roaming on ALLTEL's wireless network, partially offset by growth in CDMA minutes of use as other CDMA carriers direct wholesale traffic to ALLTEL's network. Telecommunications information services revenues decreased $67.1 million in 2004 compared to 2003, primarily due to the December 2003 sale of certain assets and related liabilities, including selected customer contracts and capitalized software development costs, to Convergys Information Management Group, Inc. (''Convergys''), and the loss in 2004 of one of ALLTEL's remaining unaffiliated wireline services customers. Revenues from long-distance and network management services decreased $15.2 million in 2004, primarily due to declining usage by residential customers and a reduction in intercompany and residential customer billing rates. Wireline local service and network access and toll revenues decreased $51.6 million in 2004, primarily as a result of the loss of wireline access lines and a $20.3 million reduction in high-cost funding received by ALLTEL's wireline subsidiaries under the USF program.

Write-down of software development costs
development cost
During the second quarter of 2003, the Company recorded a restructuring charge of $8.5 million consisting of severance and employee benefit costs related to a planned workforce reduction, primarily resulting from the closing of certain call center locations. As of December 31, 2004, ALLTEL had paid $8.5 million in severance and employee-related expenses, and all of the employee reductions had been completed. ALLTEL also recorded a $2.7 million reduction in the liabilities associated with various restructuring activities initiated prior to 2003, consisting of $2.2 million in severance and employee benefit costs and $0.5 million in lease termination costs. The reduction primarily reflected differences between estimated and actual costs paid in completing the previous planned workforce reductions and lease terminations. In the second quarter of 2003, ALLTEL also wrote off certain capitalized software development costs that had no alternative future use or functionality.
development cost
During the evaluation of its existing CLEC operations, ALLTEL determined that a business model that relied heavily on interconnection with other carriers had limited potential for profitably acquiring market share. Accordingly, in January 2002, the Company announced its plans to exit its CLEC operations in seven states representing less than 20 percent of its CLEC access lines. In the course of exiting these markets, ALLTEL honored all existing customer contracts, licenses and other obligations and worked to minimize the inconvenience to affected customers by migrating these customers to other service providers. During 2002, the Company also consolidated its call center, retail store and product distribution operations. In connection with these activities, the Company recorded restructuring charges totaling $27.4 million consisting of $14.8 million in severance and employee benefit costs related to planned workforce reductions and $12.6 million of costs associated with terminating certain CLEC transport agreements and lease termination fees incurred with the closing of certain retail, call center and product distribution locations. In exiting the CLEC operations, the Company also incurred costs to disconnect and remove switching and other transmission equipment from central office facilities and expenses to notify and migrate customers to other service providers. ALLTEL also wrote off certain capitalized software development costs that had no alternative future use or functionality. The restructuring plans were completed in 2002 and resulted in the elimination of 1,040 employees primarily in the Company's sales, customer service and network operations support functions and ALLTEL's product distribution operations. As of December 31, 2004, the Company had paid $14.3 million in severance and employee-related expenses, and all of the employee reductions had been completed.
development cost
In 2003, ALLTEL sold to Convergys certain assets and related liabilities, including selected customer contracts and capitalized software development costs, associated with the Company's telecommunications information services operations. In connection with this sale, the Company received proceeds of $37.0 million and recorded a pretax gain of $31.0 million. ALLTEL also recorded pretax write-downs totaling $6.0 million to reflect other-than-temporary declines in the fair value of certain investments in unconsolidated limited partnerships. As noted above, during the second quarter of 2003, ALLTEL retired, prior to stated maturity dates, $249.1 million of long-term debt. In connection with the early retirement of this debt, the Company incurred pretax termination fees of $7.1 million. These transactions increased net income $10.7 million in 2003.
development cost
Included in operating expenses for 2002 was a $42.3 million charge associated with discontinuing the Company's business venture with Bradford & Bingley Group. The charge primarily consisted of the write-off of capitalized software development costs that had no alternative use or functionality. The charge also included the write-off of unamortized leasehold improvements and other costs to unwind the business venture. (See Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the disposal of the financial services operations.)
development cost
Communications support services revenues and sales decreased $35.2 million, or 4 percent, in 2004 and increased $33.3 million, or 4 percent, in 2003. As noted in the table above, the decrease in revenues and sales in 2004 reflected declines in long-distance and network management services and telecommunications information services, partially offset by an increase in sales of telecommunications equipment and data products and directory publishing revenues. Revenues attributable to long-distance and network management services declined $15.2 million in 2004. Although the number of long-distance customers served increased during 2004, revenues derived from external customers decreased $10.7 million from 2003, primarily due to declining usage by residential customers and a reduction in customer billing rates due to competition. Revenues earned from affiliates for network management services also decreased $4.5 million in 2004, primarily due to a reduction in intercompany billing rates which took effect April 1, 2004. Telecommunications information services revenues decreased $67.1 million in 2004, primarily due to the December 2003 sale of certain assets and related liabilities, including selected customer contracts and capitalized software development costs, to Convergys, and the loss of one of ALLTEL's remaining unaffiliated wireline services customers. The customer contracts sold to Convergys represented approximately 48 percent of the total revenues and sales reported by the telecommunications information services operations in 2003.
development cost
Capital expenditures continued to be ALLTEL's primary use of capital resources. Capital expenditures were $1,125.4 million in 2004, $1,137.7 million in 2003 and $1,154.8 million in 2002. Capital expenditures in each of the past three years were incurred to construct additional network facilities, to deploy digital technology in the Company's existing and acquired wireless markets and to upgrade ALLTEL's telecommunications network in order to offer other communications services, including long-distance, Internet, DSL and ''Touch-2-Talk'' communications services. Capital expenditures for 2004 also included the Company's initial investment in wireless EV-DO technology in several markets. ALLTEL expects to deploy EV-DO technology in 6 to 10 additional markets in 2005. During each of the past three years, ALLTEL funded substantially all of its capital expenditures through internally generated funds. As indicated in the table above under ''Segment Capital Requirements'', ALLTEL expects capital expenditures to be approximately $1,255.0 million to $1,355.0 million for 2005, which will be funded primarily from internally generated funds. Investing activities also included outlays for capitalized software development costs, which were $32.3 million in 2004, $56.7 million in 2003 and $58.4 million in 2002. As indicated in the table above under ''Segment Capital Requirements'', ALLTEL expects expenditures for capitalized software development to be approximately $45.0 million for 2005, which also will be funded from internally generated funds.
development cost
Net income for 2003 included pretax charges of $8.5 million primarily related to the closing of certain call center locations and the write-off of $13.2 million of certain capitalized software development costs with no alternative future use or functionality. The Company also recorded a $2.7 million reduction in the liabilities associated with various restructuring activities initiated prior to 2003 to reflect differences between estimated and actual costs paid in completing the previous planned restructuring activities.

In the second quarter of 2003, the Company recorded a restructuring charge of $8.5 million related to a planned workforce reduction, primarily resulting from the closing of certain call center locations, and recorded a $2.7 million reduction in the liabilities associated with various restructuring activities initiated prior to 2003. The Company also wrote off $13.2 million of certain capitalized software development costs that had no alternative future use or functionality. (See Note 9.) In the second quarter of 2003, ALLTEL also recorded pretax write-downs totaling $6.0 million to reflect other-than-temporary declines in the fair value of certain investments in unconsolidated limited partnerships. In addition, the Company incurred pretax termination fees of $7.1 million related to the early retirement of long-term debt. These transactions decreased net income $19.8 million or $.06 per share.

In December 2003, ALLTEL sold to Convergys Information Management Group (Convergys) for $37.0 million in cash certain assets and related liabilities, including selected customer contracts and capitalized software development costs, associated with the Companys telecommunications information services operations.
development cost
The Companys telecommunications information services operations (the telecom division) are primarily engaged in the development and marketing of billing services and customer care software, including its Virtuoso II billing and customer care product, to local telephone, wireless and PCS companies. In addition, the telecom division provides data processing and outsourcing services to both wireline and wireless telecommunications service providers. Information processing contracts are generally for a multi-year period. The telecom divisions primary markets for its telecommunications products and services consist of telephone, cellular and PCS companies in the United States and Canada which serve more than 10,000 customers, or a market consisting of approximately 200 telecommunications companies. As previously discussed, in December 2003, the Company sold to Convergys certain assets and related liabilities, including selected customer contracts and capitalized software development costs. The sold customer contracts represented approximately 48 percent of the total revenues and sales reported by the telecommunications information services operations in 2003.
development cost
During 2003, the Company recorded integration expenses and other charges of $8.5 million in connection with the restructuring of the Companys call center operations. The Company also recorded a $2.7 million reduction in the liabilities associated with various restructuring activities initiated prior to 2003, and ALLTEL also wrote off $13.2 million of capitalized software development costs that had no alternative future use or functionality.

2003, the Company had paid $8.3 million in severance and employee-related expenses, and all of the employee reductions had been completed. The Company also recorded a $2.7 million reduction in the liabilities associated with various restructuring activities initiated prior to 2003, consisting of $2.2 million in severance and employee benefit costs and $0.5 million in lease termination costs. The reduction primarily reflected differences between estimated and actual costs paid in completing the previous planned workforce reductions and lease terminations. During the second quarter of 2003, ALLTEL also wrote off certain capitalized software development costs that had no alternative future use or functionality.

The restructuring plans, completed in March 2002, provided for the elimination of 910 employees primarily in the Companys sales, customer service and network operations support functions. As previously discussed, in the fourth quarter of 2002, ALLTEL reduced the liabilities associated with these restructuring plans by $2.5 million. As of December 31, 2003, the Company had paid $12.3 million in severance and employee-related expenses, and all of the employee reductions had been completed.

In 2003, ALLTEL sold to Convergys Information Management Group (Convergys) certain assets and related liabilities, including selected customer contracts and capitalized software development costs, associated with the Companys telecommunications information services operations. In connection with this sale, the Company received proceeds of $37.0 million and recorded a pretax gain of $31.0 million. ALLTEL also recorded pretax write-downs totaling $6.0 million to reflect other-than-temporary declines in the fair value of certain investments in unconsolidated limited partnerships. As noted above, during the second quarter of 2003, ALLTEL retired, prior to stated maturity dates, $249.1 million of long-term debt. In connection with the early retirement of this debt, the Company incurred pretax termination fees of $7.1 million. These transactions increased net income $10.7 million in 2003.
development cost
The depreciation of long-lived assets related to the financial services division ceased as of January 28, 2003, the date of the agreement to sell such operations. The cessation of depreciation had the effect of reducing operating expenses by approximately $13.0 million in 2003. The Company recorded an after-tax gain of $323.9 million upon completion of the sale of the financial services division. Included in operating expenses for 2002 was a $42.3 million charge associated with discontinuing the Companys business venture with Bradford & Bingley Group. The charge primarily consisted of the write-off of capitalized software development costs that had no alternative use or functionality. The charge also included the write-off of unamortized leasehold improvements and other costs to unwind the business venture.
development cost
increased $60.0 million in 2003, primarily due to increased sales of wireless handsets to retailers and other distributors. Conversely, the general reduction in capital spending by telecommunications companies adversely affected sales to non-affiliates in 2003, reflecting current economic conditions and the industrys emphasis on controlling costs. In 2003, sales to affiliates decreased $23.9 million from 2002, consistent with the overall reduction in capital expenditures related to ALLTELs wireline operations. Compared to 2002, revenues from long-distance and network management services increased $3.9 million in 2003, primarily due to 9 percent growth in ALLTELs customer base for long-distance services, partially offset by reductions in customer billing rates due to competition. Directory publishing revenues increased $3.5 million in 2003, primarily reflecting additional revenues of $6.1 million attributable to growth in the number of directory contracts published. The revenues earned from these additional contracts were partially offset by a change in accounting for directory contracts in which the Company has a secondary delivery obligation. ALLTEL began deferring a portion of its revenues and related costs to provide for secondary deliveries effective January 1, 2003. Telecommunications information services revenues decreased $10.2 million in 2003, primarily resulting from a reduction in programming services provided to one customer, lost operations due to a contract termination and the completion in 2002 of customer specific conversion projects and other transitional services. As previously discussed, in December 2003, the Company sold to Convergys certain assets and related liabilities, including selected customer contracts and capitalized software development costs. The sold customer contracts represented approximately 48 percent of the total revenues and sales reported by the telecommunications information services operations in 2003.
development cost
Capital expenditures continued to be ALLTELs primary use of capital resources. Capital expenditures were $1,137.7 million in 2003, $1,154.8 million in 2002 and $1,170.1 million in 2001. Capital expenditures in each of the past three years were incurred to construct additional network facilities, to deploy digital wireless technology in the Companys existing and acquired wireless markets and to upgrade ALLTELs telecommunications network in order to offer other communications services, including long-distance, Internet, DSL and push-to-talk communications services. During each of the past three years, the Company funded substantially all of its capital expenditures through internally generated funds. As indicated in the table above under Segment Capital Requirements, ALLTEL expects capital expenditures to be approximately $1,140.0 million to $1,240.0 million for 2004, which will be funded primarily from internally generated funds. Investing activities also included outlays for capitalized software development costs. Additions to capitalized software were $56.7 million in 2003, $58.4 million in 2002 and $80.5 million in 2001. Capitalized software development
development cost
costs for 2001 included additional spending for the development and enhancement of internal use software to support the Companys retail operations. Spending levels in 2002 for capitalized software development costs reflected the completion of these projects. As indicated in the table above under Segment Capital Requirements, the Company expects expenditures for capitalized software development to be approximately $60.0 million for 2004, which also will be funded primarily from internally generated funds.
development cost
Net income for 2003 included pretax charges of $8.5 million primarily related to the closing of certain call center locations and the write-off of $13.2 million of certain capitalized software development costs with no alternative future use or functionality. The Company also recorded a $2.7 million reduction in the liabilities associated with various restructuring activities initiated prior to 2003 to reflect differences between estimated and actual costs paid in completing the previous planned restructuring activities. These transactions decreased net income $11.5 million or $.04 per share. (See Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements.) Net income for 2003 also included a pretax gain of $31.0 million realized from the sale of certain assets of the telecommunications information services operations, partially offset by pretax write-downs totaling $6.0 million to reflect other-than-temporary declines in the fair value of certain investments in unconsolidated limited partnerships. In addition, the Company incurred pretax termination fees of $7.1 million related to the early retirement of long-term debt. These transactions increased net income $10.7 million or $.04 per share. (See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements.) Effective January 1, 2003, ALLTEL adopted SFAS No. 143 in accounting for asset retirement obligations. The cumulative effect of this accounting change resulted in a one-time non-cash credit of $15.6 million, net of income tax expense of $10.3 million, or $.05 per share. (See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.)

Additions to capitalized software development costs
development cost
 Property, plant and equipment are stated at original cost. Wireless plant consists of cell site towers, switching, controllers and other radio frequency equipment. Wireline plant consists of aerial and underground cable, conduit, poles, switches and other central office and transmission-related equipment. Information processing plant consists of data processing equipment, purchased software and internal use capitalized software development costs. Other plant consists of furniture, fixtures, vehicles, machinery and equipment. The costs of additions, replacements and substantial improvements, including related labor costs are capitalized, while the costs of maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. For ALLTELs non-regulated operations, when depreciable plant is retired or otherwise disposed of, the related cost and accumulated depreciation are deducted from the plant accounts, with the corresponding gain or loss reflected in operating results. The Companys wireline subsidiaries utilize group composite depreciation. Under this method, when plant is retired, the original cost, net of salvage value is charged against accumulated depreciation, and no gain or loss is recognized on the disposition of the plant. Depreciation expense amounted to $1,187.4 million in 2003, $1,050.1 million in 2002 and $945.3 million in 2001. Depreciation for financial reporting purposes is computed using the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives:

In January 2002, ALLTEL announced its plans to exit its CLEC operations in seven states. The Company also consolidated its call center and retail store operations during the first quarter of 2002. In connection with these activities, ALLTEL recorded a restructuring charge consisting of severance and employee benefit costs related to a planned workforce reduction, costs associated with terminating certain CLEC transport agreements and lease termination fees related to the closing of certain retail and call center locations. In exiting the CLEC operations, the Company also incurred costs to disconnect and remove switching and other transmission equipment from central office facilities and expenses to notify and migrate customers to other service providers. ALLTEL also wrote off certain capitalized software development costs that had no alternative future use or functionality. The restructuring plans, completed in March 2002, provided for the elimination of 910 employees primarily in the Companys sales, customer service and network operations support functions.

Write-down of software development costs
development cost
On December 13, 2002, ALLTEL and Bradford & Bingley Group announced both companies had agreed to discontinue a business venture. The business venture, ALLTEL Mortgage Solutions, Ltd., was created in 2000 to provide mortgage administration and information technology products to the mortgage lending industry in the United Kingdom. Unfortunately, the existing business climate in the United Kingdom limited the business ventures ability to leverage the business across a broad base of customers. As a result of this announcement, ALLTEL recorded a write-down of its investment in the business venture, which primarily consisted of capitalized software development costs that had no alternative future use or functionality. The write-down also included unamortized leasehold improvements and other costs to unwind the business venture. During the fourth quarter of 2002, the Company also recorded lease termination costs of $1.5 million related to the closing of two data processing centers. The lease termination costs reflected the estimated minimum contractual commitments over the ensuing one to two years to terminate leases associated with these operating locations. The Company also recorded a $2.5 million reduction in the liabilities associated with the restructuring of its CLEC operations initiated during the first quarter of 2002, as discussed below. The reduction primarily reflected differences between estimated and actual costs to exit certain CLEC markets and consisted of $2.0 million in lease termination costs and $0.5 million in severance and employee benefit costs.
development cost
In 2001, during the evaluation of its existing CLEC operations, the Company determined that a business model that relied heavily on interconnection with other carriers had limited potential for profitably acquiring market share. Accordingly, in January 2002, the Company announced its plans to exit its CLEC operations in seven states representing less than 20 percent of ALLTELs CLEC access lines. In the course of exiting these markets, ALLTEL honored all existing customer contracts, licenses and other obligations and worked to minimize the inconvenience to affected customers by migrating these customers to other service providers. During the first quarter of 2002, the Company also consolidated its call center and retail store operations. In connection with these activities, the Company recorded a restructuring charge consisting of severance and employee benefit costs related to a planned workforce reduction, costs associated with terminating certain CLEC transport agreements and lease termination fees incurred with the closing of certain retail and call center locations. In exiting the CLEC operations, the Company also incurred costs to disconnect and remove switching and other transmission equipment from central office facilities and expenses to notify and migrate customers to other service providers.

certain retail and other operating locations and an $8.9 million write-down in the carrying value of certain software development costs. Included in the severance and employee benefit component of the restructuring charges were non-cash charges of $22.6 million. These non-cash charges consisted of $21.5 million in additional pension and post-retirement benefit costs related to a special early retirement program offered by the Company to employees meeting certain age and service requirements and $1.1 million in compensation expense related to the accelerated vesting of certain stock options. Eligible employees who elected the early retirement incentive received five years of additional vested service for purposes of calculating their retirement benefits available under the Companys pension and post-retirement benefit plans. During the first quarter of 2001, 230 employees accepted the retirement incentive offer. The restructuring plans were completed in December 2001 and resulted in the elimination of 1,644 employees, including the employees who accepted the early retirement incentive. The work force reductions occurred primarily in operations management, engineering, sales and the corporate support functions. As of December 31, 2002, the Company had paid $39.4 million in severance and employee-related expenses, and all of the employee reductions had been completed.
development cost
The lease termination costs recorded in 2001 included $5.0 million representing the estimated minimum contractual commitments over the next one to five years for 63 operating locations that the Company abandoned, net of anticipated sublease income. The lease termination costs also included $1.1 million of unamortized leasehold improvement costs related to the abandoned locations. The write-down in the carrying value of certain software development costs resulted from the Companys formation of a business venture with IBM announced in March 2001. The business venture, which operates as ALLTEL Corebanking Solutions, a majority-owned consolidated subsidiary of ALLTEL, develops and markets Corebank, a real-time banking system, to financial service organizations in Europe. Prior to forming the business venture, ALLTEL had been developing its own real-time processing software. Following the signing of the business venture agreement, ALLTEL ceased further development of its software product and wrote off the portion of the capitalized software development costs that had no alternative future use or functionality.
development cost
In connection with the Companys business venture with IBM, ALLTEL has capitalized approximately $28.0 million in software development costs. The Company expects to capitalize in 2003 approximately $6.0 million of additional software development costs related to this business venture. The process of developing new software products is complex and requires the Company to make long-term investments and commit significant resources before realizing revenue streams. Accordingly, the future profitability of this business venture and the Companys ability to recover its investment will be dependent upon ALLTELs success in marketing the software and related services to customers.
development cost
Investing activities also included outlays for capitalized software development costs. Additions to capitalized software were $119.0 million in 2002, $171.4 million in 2001 and $117.3 million in 2000. Capitalized software development costs for 2001 included additional spending on certain of the Companys proprietary financial services software products related to customer specific development projects. Spending levels for capitalized software development costs in 2002 reflected the completion of these projects during 2001. Capitalized software development costs for 2002 and 2001 also included costs incurred for the development and enhancement of internal use software to support the Companys retail operations. As indicated in the table above under Segment Capital Requirements, the Company expects expenditures for capitalized software development to be approximately $90.0 million to $100.0 million for 2003, which also will be funded primarily from internally generated funds.
development cost
At each balance sheet date, ALLTEL performs a detailed assessment of its capitalized software development costs to be marketed which includes a review of, among other factors, projected revenues, customer demand requirements, product lifecycle, changes in software and hardware technologies, and product development plans. Based on this analysis, ALLTEL records adjustments, when appropriate, to reflect the net realizable value of its capitalized software development costs. The estimates of expected future revenues generated by the software, the remaining economic life of the software, or both, could be reduced in the near term, materially affecting the carrying value of capitalized software development costs and the Companys consolidated operating results in the period of change.
development cost
Net income for 2002 included pretax charges of $42.3 million incurred in connection with discontinuing a business venture with Bradford & Bingley Group to provide mortgage administration and information technology products to the mortgage lending industry in the United Kingdom. The pretax charges primarily consisted of the write-off of capitalized software development costs with no alternative future use or functionality and other costs to unwind the business venture. The Company also incurred pretax charges of $31.4 million incurred in connection with the restructuring of the Companys competitive local exchange carrier (CLEC), call center and retail store operations. ALLTEL also recorded a restructuring charge of $5.5 million related to a planned workforce reduction and the closing of seven product distribution centers. During 2002, the Company also incurred integration expenses of $28.8 million related to its acquisitions of wireline properties from Verizon Communications, Inc. and wireless properties from CenturyTel, Inc. The Company also recorded write-downs in the carrying value of certain cell site equipment of $7.1 million. These charges decreased net income $62.5 million or $.20 per share. (See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements.) Net income for 2002 included a pretax gain of $22.1 million realized from the sale of a wireless property, partially offset by pretax write-downs of $16.3 million related to the Companys investments in Hughes Tele.com Limited and Airspan Networks, Inc. The Company also recorded a pretax adjustment of $4.8 million to reduce the gain recognized from the dissolution of a wireless partnership that was initially recorded in 2001. These transactions increased net income $0.6 million or less than $.01 per share. (See Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements.)

Write-down of software development costs
development cost
As indicated in the table above, the restructuring charges consisted of $62.1 million in severance and employee benefit costs related to planned workforce reductions, $6.1 million in lease termination costs associated with the closing of certain retail and other operating locations and a $8.9 million write-down in the carrying value of certain software development costs. Included in the severance and employee benefit component of the restructuring charges were non-cash charges of $22.6 million. These non-cash charges consisted of $21.5 million in additional pension and post-retirement benefit costs related to a special early retirement program offered by the Company to employees meeting certain age and service requirements and $1.1 million in compensation expense related to the accelerated vesting of certain stock options. Eligible employees who elected the early retirement incentive received five years of additional vested service for purposes of calculating their retirement benefits available under the Company's pension and post-retirement benefit plans. During the first quarter of 2001, 230 employees accepted the retirement incentive offer. The restructuring plans were completed in December 2001 and resulted in the elimination of 1,644 employees, including the employees who accepted the early retirement incentive. The work force reductions occurred primarily in operations management, engineering, sales and the corporate support functions. As of December 31, 2001, the Company had paid $37.9 million in severance and employee-related expenses, and all of the employee reductions had been completed.
development cost
The lease termination costs recorded in 2001 included $5.0 million representing the estimated minimum contractual commitments over the next one to five years for 63 operating locations that the Company abandoned, net of anticipated sublease income. The lease termination costs also included $1.1 million of unamortized leasehold improvement costs related to the abandoned locations. The write-down in the carrying value of certain software development costs resulted from the Company's formation of a joint venture with IBM announced in March 2001. The joint venture, which operates as ALLTEL Corebanking Solutions, markets IBM's Corebank software, a real time, continuous banking system, to financial service organizations in Europe. Prior to forming the joint venture, ALLTEL had been developing its own real-time processing software. Following the signing of the joint venture agreement, ALLTEL ceased further development of its software product and wrote off the portion of the capitalized software development costs that had no alternative future use or functionality.
development cost
In connection with the Company's joint ventures with IBM and with Bradford & Bingley Group, ALLTEL capitalized $35.8 million in software development costs during 2001. The Company expects to capitalize in 2002 approximately $20.0 to $25.0 million of additional software development costs related to these joint ventures. The process of developing new software products is complex and requires the Company to make long-term investments and commit significant resources before realizing revenue streams from these joint ventures. Accordingly, the future profitability of these joint ventures and the Company's ability to recover its investment will be dependent upon ALLTEL's success in marketing the software and related services to customers.
development cost
At each balance sheet date, ALLTEL performs a detailed assessment of its capitalized software development costs to be marketed which includes a review of, among other factors, projected revenues, customer demand requirements, product lifecycle, changes in software and hardware technologies, and product development plans. Based on this analysis, ALLTEL records adjustments, when appropriate, to reflect the net realizable value of its capitalized software development costs. The estimates of expected future revenues generated by the software, the remaining economic life of the software, or both, could be reduced in the near term, materially affecting the carrying value of capitalized software development costs and the Company's consolidated operating results in the period of change.

Amortization of the capitalized amounts is computed on a product-by-product basis using the straight-line method over the remaining estimated economic life of the product, generally three to six years for software to be marketed. Internal use software is amortized over ten years. Amortization expense amounted to $85.5 million in 2001, $68.6 million in 2000 and $46.4 million in 1999. The Company periodically evaluates the carrying value of capitalized software development costs to be marketed. If the net realizable value of the capitalized software development costs is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference. The determination of net realizable value requires considerable judgment by management with respect to certain external factors, including, but not limited to, expected future revenues generated by the software, the estimated economic life of the software and changes in software and hardware technologies. Accordingly, it is reasonably possible that estimates of expected future revenues generated by the software, the remaining economic life of the software, or both, could be reduced in the near term, materially affecting the carrying value of capitalized software development costs.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
research and development
Our products and markets demand rapid technological advancements requiring a continuous effort to enhance existing products and develop new products and technologies. Accordingly, we maintain a high level of research and development activity. We invested
research and development
in research and development during fiscal 2018, fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016, respectively. The growth in research and development expenses were the result of increases in our internal product designs and product development activity for our target markets in each of these fiscal years. Our research and development expenses include new product development and innovations in integrated circuit design, investment in advanced semiconductor manufacturing processes, development of new packaging and test capabilities and research on next generation technologies and product opportunities. We maintain close collaborative relationships with many of our customers to help identify market demands and target our development efforts to meet those demands.
research and development
Our products are not sold directly to the end-user, but are components or subsystems of other products. As a result, we rely on OEMs and ODMs of wireless communications electronics products to select our products from among alternative offerings to be designed into their equipment. Without these “design wins,” we would have difficulty selling our products. If a manufacturer designs another supplier’s product into one of its product platforms, it is more difficult for us to achieve future design wins with that platform because changing suppliers involves significant cost, time, effort and risk on the part of that manufacturer. Also, achieving a design win with a customer does not ensure that we will receive revenue from that customer. Even after a design win, the customer is not obligated to purchase our products and can choose at any time to reduce or cease use of our products, for example, if its own products are not commercially successful, or for any other reason. We may not continue to achieve design wins or to convert design wins into actual sales, and failure to do so could materially and adversely affect our operating results. Furthermore, as a result of our lengthy product development and sales cycle, we may incur significant research and development expenses, and selling, general and administrative expenses, without generating the anticipated revenue associated with these products.
research and development
Security breaches, phishing, spoofing, attempts by others to gain unauthorized access to our information technology systems, and other cyberattacks are becoming more sophisticated and are sometimes successful. These incidents, which might be related to industrial or other espionage, include covertly introducing malware to our computers and networks (or to an electronic system operated by a third party for our benefit) and impersonating authorized users, among others. We seek to detect and investigate all security incidents and to prevent their recurrence, but in some cases, we might be unaware of an incident or its magnitude and effects. The theft, unauthorized use, transfer, or publication of our intellectual property, our confidential business information, or the personal data of our employees by third parties or by our employees could harm our competitive position, reduce the value of our investment in research and development and other strategic initiatives or otherwise adversely affect our business. To the extent that any security breach or other cybersecurity incident results in inappropriate disclosure of our customers’, suppliers’, licensees’ or employees’ confidential information, we may incur liability as a result. We expect to continue devoting significant resources to the security of our information technology systems and the training of our employees. However, we cannot ensure that our efforts will be sufficient to prevent or mitigate the damage caused by a cyberattack, cybersecurity incident or network disruption.
research and development
our views on potential future capital requirements, including those related to acquisitions as well as research and development,
research and development
Although we have invested in the past, and intend to continue to invest, significant resources in internal research and development activities, the complexity and rapidity of technological changes and the significant expense of internal research and development make it impractical for us to pursue development of all technological solutions on our own. On an ongoing basis, we review investment, alliance and acquisition prospects that would complement our product offerings, augment our market coverage or enhance our technological capabilities. We may not be able to identify and consummate suitable investment, alliance or acquisition transactions in the future. Moreover, if such transactions are consummated, they could result in:
research and development
A number of domestic and foreign jurisdictions restrict or may seek to restrict the use of various substances, a number of which have been or are currently used in our products or processes. For example, the European Union Restriction of Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment (“RoHS”) Directive requires that certain substances, which may be found in certain products we have manufactured in the past, be removed from all electronics components. Eliminating such substances from our manufacturing processes requires the expenditure of additional research and development funds to seek alternative substances for our products, as well as increased testing by third parties to ensure the quality of our products and compliance with the RoHS Directive. While we have implemented a compliance program to ensure our product offering meets these regulations, there may be instances where alternative substances will not be available or commercially feasible, or may only be available from a single source, or may be significantly more expensive than their restricted counterparts. Additionally, if we were found to be non-compliant with any such rule or regulation, we could be subject to fines, penalties and/or restrictions imposed by government agencies that could adversely affect our operating results.
research and development
The number of stockholders of record of our common stock as of November 7, 2018, was 12,404. On November 8, 2018, the Company announced that the Board of Directors had declared a cash dividend of $0.38 per share of common stock, payable on December 18, 2018, to stockholders of record as of November 27, 2018. We intend to continue to pay quarterly dividends subject to capital availability and our view that cash dividends are in the best interests of our stockholders. Future cash dividends may be affected by, among other items, our views on potential future capital requirements, including those relating to research and development, creation and expansion of sales distribution channels and investments and acquisitions, legal risks, stock repurchase programs, debt issuance, changes in federal and state income tax law and changes to our business model.

Research and development expenses consist primarily of direct personnel costs including share-based compensation expense, costs for pre-production evaluation and testing of new devices, masks, engineering prototypes and design tool costs.
research and development
The increase in research and development expense in fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017 is primarily related to increased headcount, overall employee-related compensation expense, and expenses associated with product development activity. Research and development expense increased as a percentage of net revenue due to increased development complexity and our efforts to increase the value of our future products.
research and development
The increase in research and development expense in fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016 is primarily related to increased headcount, overall employee-related compensation expense, and expenses associated with product development activity. Research and development expense increased slightly as a percentage of net revenue due to the aforementioned factors.
research and development
The annual effective tax rate for fiscal 2018 of 31.1% was greater than the United States federal statutory rate of 24.6% primarily due to increases in tax from a one-time charge related to the mandatory deemed repatriation tax on foreign earnings of 16.9%, a one-time charge related to the revaluation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities of 1.4%, and income tax rate expense impact of 0.5% related to a change in our tax reserves, partially offset by benefits of 8.4% related to foreign earnings taxed at a rate less than the United States federal rate, 1.0% related to a domestic production activities deduction, 1.9% related to stock windfall deductions, and 1.5% related to the recognition of federal research and development tax credits.
research and development
The annual effective tax rate for fiscal 2017 of 19.6% was less than the United States federal statutory rate of 35.0% primarily due to benefits of 14.3% related to foreign earnings taxed at a rate less than the United States federal rate, 1.6% related to a domestic production activities deduction, and 1.3% related to the recognition of federal research and development tax credits, partially offset by income tax rate expense impact of 1.0% related to a change in our tax reserves.

However, we cannot be certain that our cash on hand and cash generated from operations will be available in the future to fund all of our capital and operating requirements. In addition, any future strategic investments and acquisitions may require additional cash and capital resources.

in research and development during fiscal 2017, fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015, respectively. The growth in research and development expenses were the result of increases in our internal product designs and product development activity for our target markets in each of these fiscal years. Our research and development expenses include new product development and innovations in integrated circuit design, investment in advanced semiconductor manufacturing processes, development of new packaging and test capabilities and research on next generation technologies and product opportunities. We maintain close collaborative relationships with many of our customers to help identify market demands and target our development efforts to meet those demands.

Attempts by others to gain unauthorized access to our information technology systems are becoming more sophisticated and are sometimes successful. These attempts, which might be related to industrial or other espionage, include covertly introducing malware to our computers and networks and impersonating authorized users, among others. We seek to detect and investigate all security incidents and to prevent their recurrence, but in some cases, we might be unaware of an incident or its magnitude and effects. The theft, unauthorized use or publication of our intellectual property and/or confidential business information by third parties or by our employees could harm our competitive position, reduce the value of our investment in research and development and other strategic initiatives or otherwise adversely affect our business. To the extent that any security breach results in inappropriate disclosure of our customers’, licensees’ or employees’ confidential information, we may incur liability as a result.

On an ongoing basis, we review investment, alliance and acquisition prospects that would complement our product offerings, augment our market coverage or enhance our technological capabilities. We may not be able to identify and consummate suitable investment, alliance or acquisition transactions in the future. Moreover, if such transactions are consummated, they could result in:

A number of domestic and foreign jurisdictions restrict or may seek to restrict the use of various substances, a number of which have been or are currently used in our products or processes. For example, the European Union Restriction of Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment (“RoHS”) Directive requires that certain substances, which may be found in certain products we have manufactured in the past, be removed from all electronics components. Eliminating such substances from our manufacturing processes requires the expenditure of additional research and development funds to seek alternative substances for our products, as well as increased testing by third parties to ensure the quality of our products and compliance with the RoHS Directive. While we have implemented a compliance program to ensure our product offering meets these regulations, there may be instances where alternative substances will not be available or commercially feasible, or may only be available from a single source, or may be significantly more expensive than their restricted counterparts. Additionally, if we were found to be non-compliant with any such rule or regulation, we could be subject to fines, penalties and/or restrictions imposed by government agencies that could adversely affect our operating results.

We intend to continue to pay quarterly dividends subject to capital availability and our view that cash dividends are in the best interests of our stockholders. Future cash dividends may be affected by, among other items, our views on potential future capital requirements, including those relating to research and development, creation and expansion of sales distribution channels and investments and acquisitions, legal risks, stock repurchase programs, debt issuance, changes in federal and state income tax law and changes to our business model.

The increase in research and development expense in fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016 is primarily related to increased headcount, overall employee-related compensation expense, and expenses associated with product development activity. Research and development expense increased slightly as a percentage of net revenue due to the aforementioned factors.

Our products are not sold directly to the end-user, but are components or subsystems of other products. As a result, we rely on OEMs and ODMs of wireless communications electronics products to select our products from among alternative offerings to be designed into their equipment. Without these “design wins,” we would have difficulty selling our products. If a manufacturer designs another supplier’s product into one of its product platforms, it is more difficult for us to achieve future design wins with that platform because changing suppliers involves significant cost, time, effort and risk on the part of that manufacturer. Also, achieving a design win with a customer does not ensure that we will receive revenue from that customer. Even after a design win, the customer is not obligated to purchase our products and can choose at any time to reduce or cease use of our products, for example, if its own products are not commercially successful, or for any other reason. We may not continue to achieve design wins or to convert design wins into actual sales, and failure to do so could materially and adversely affect our operating results.

The increase in research and development expense in fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 is primarily related to increased compensation expense, including share-based compensation of $19.1 million, enhanced development activity, related services and other costs of $6.8 million. Research and development expense decreased as a percentage of net revenue due to the aforementioned increase in net revenue.
research and development
The increase in research and development expense in fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 is primarily attributable to a net increase of $8.3 million related to product design and development activity including the full year impact of AATI activities as well as a net increase of $6.7 million in compensation expense. These increases were partially offset by reductions related to the organizational restructuring initiated during the fiscal year. Research and development expense decreased as a percentage of net revenue due to the aforementioned increase in net revenue.

The annual effective tax rate for fiscal 2013 of 19.3% was less than the United States federal statutory rate of 35% primarily due to benefits of 14.7% related to foreign earnings taxed at a rate less than the United States federal rate, benefits of 4.7% related to research and development tax credits, and benefits of 1.5% related to a domestic production activities deduction partially offset by income tax rate expense impact of 3.4% related to a change in our tax reserves.

Based on our historical results of operations, we expect that our cash and cash equivalents on hand and the cash we expect to generate from operations will be sufficient to fund our research and development, capital expenditures, acquisitions, working capital, quarterly cash dividend payments (if such dividends are declared by the Board of Directors) and other cash requirements for at least the next 12 months. However, we cannot be certain that our cash on hand and cash generated from operations will be available in the future to fund all of our capital and operating requirements. In addition, any future strategic investments and acquisitions may require additional cash and capital resources. If we are unable to obtain sufficient cash or capital to meet our needs on a timely basis and on favorable terms, our business and operations could be materially and adversely affected.

Our products and markets demand rapid technological advancements requiring a continuous effort to enhance existing products and develop new products and technologies. Accordingly, we maintain a high level of research and development activity. We invested
research and development
in research and development activities during the fiscal years ended
research and development
, respectively. The increase in research and development expense from fiscal 2012 to fiscal 2013 was a result of increases in our internal product design and development for our target markets. The increase in research and development expense from fiscal 2011 to fiscal 2012 was a result of the additional headcount and development activities associated with the acquisitions of AATI and SiGe, as well as increases in our internal product design and development for our target markets. Our research and development activities include new product development and innovations in integrated circuit design, investment in advanced semiconductor manufacturing processes, developing new packaging and test capabilities and researching next generation technologies and product opportunities. We maintain close collaborative relationships with many of our customers to help identify market demands and target our development efforts to meet those demands.
research and development
After one of our products has been developed, tested and manufactured, our customers may need three to six months or longer to integrate, test and evaluate that product and an additional three to six months or more to begin volume production of equipment that incorporates the product. This lengthy cycle time increases the possibility that a customer may decide to cancel or change product plans, which could reduce or eliminate our sales to that customer. As a result of this lengthy sales cycle, we may incur significant research and development expenses, and selling, general and administrative expenses, before we generate the related revenue for these products. Furthermore, we may never generate the anticipated revenues from a product after incurring such expenses if our customer cancels or changes its product plans.
research and development
Although we have invested in the past, and intend to continue to invest, significant resources in internal research and development activities, the complexity and rapidity of technological changes and the significant expense of internal research and development make it impractical for us to pursue development of all technological solutions on our own. On an ongoing basis, we review investment, alliance and acquisition prospects that would complement our product offerings, augment our market coverage or enhance our technological capabilities. We may not be able to identify and consummate suitable investment, alliance or acquisition transactions in the future. Moreover, if such transactions are consummated, they could result in:

A number of domestic and foreign jurisdictions seek to restrict the use of various substances, a number of which have been or are currently used in our products or processes. For example, the European Union Restriction of Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment ("RoHS") Directive now requires that certain substances, which may be found in certain products we have manufactured in the past, be removed from all electronics components. Eliminating such substances from our manufacturing processes requires the expenditure of additional research and development funds to seek alternative substances for our products, as well as increased testing by third parties to ensure the quality of our products and compliance with the RoHS Directive. While we have implemented a compliance program to ensure our product offering meets these regulations, there may be instances where alternative substances will not be available or commercially feasible, or may only be available from a single source, or may be significantly more expensive than their restricted counterparts. Additionally, if we were found to be non-compliant with any such rule or regulation, we could be subject to fines, penalties and/or restrictions imposed by government agencies that could adversely affect our operating results.
research and development
Attempts by others to gain unauthorized access to our information technology systems are becoming more sophisticated and are sometimes successful. These attempts, which might be related to industrial or other espionage, include covertly introducing malware to our computers and networks and impersonating authorized users, among others. We seek to detect and investigate all security incidents and to prevent their recurrence, but in some cases, we might be unaware of an incident or its magnitude and effects. The theft, unauthorized use or publication of our intellectual property and/or confidential business information could harm our competitive position, reduce the value of our investment in research and development and other strategic initiatives or otherwise adversely affect our business. To the extent that any security breach results in inappropriate disclosure of our customers' or licensees' confidential information, we may incur liability as a result.

After our product has been developed, tested and manufactured, our customers may need three to six months or longer to integrate, test and evaluate our product and an additional three to six months or more to begin volume production of equipment that incorporates the product. This lengthy cycle time increases the possibility that a customer may decide to cancel or change product plans, which could reduce or eliminate our sales to that customer. As a result of this lengthy sales cycle, we may incur significant research and development expenses, and selling, general and administrative expenses, before we generate the related revenues for these products. Furthermore, we may never generate the anticipated revenues from a product after incurring such expenses if our customer cancels or changes its product plans.

The electronics industry has been subject to increasing environmental regulations. A number of domestic and foreign jurisdictions seek to restrict the use of various substances, a number of which have been or are currently used in our products or processes. For example, the European Union Restriction of Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment (RoHS) Directive now requires that certain substances which may be found in certain products we have manufactured in the past, be removed from all electronics components. Eliminating such substances from our manufacturing processes requires the expenditure of additional research and development funds to seek alternative substances for our products, as well as increased testing by third parties to ensure the quality of our products and compliance with the RoHS Directive. While we have implemented a compliance program to ensure our product offering meets these regulations, there may be instances where alternative substances will not be available or commercially feasible, or may only be available from a single source, or may be significantly more expensive than their restricted counterparts. Additionally, if we were found to be non-compliant with any such rule or regulation, we could be subject to fines, penalties and/or restrictions imposed by government agencies that could adversely affect our operating results.
research and development
Although we have invested in the past, and intend to continue to invest, significant resources in internal research and development activities, the complexity and rapidity of technological changes and the significant expense of internal research and development make it impractical for us to pursue development of all technological solutions on our own. On an ongoing basis, we review investment, alliance and acquisition prospects that would complement our product offerings, augment our market coverage or enhance our technological capabilities. We may not be able to identify and consummate suitable investment, alliance or acquisition transactions in the future. Moreover, if such transactions are consummated, they could result in:

The 8.2% increase in research and development expenses in fiscal year 2010 when compared to fiscal year 2009 is principally attributable to higher head count and related compensation costs. In addition, the Company had ramped design activity resulting in higher mask, prototype and materials costs in support of increased product development for our target markets. Research and development expenses decreased as a percentage of net revenue for fiscal year 2010 as a result of the aforementioned increase in net revenue.

The decrease in research and development expenses in aggregate dollars and as a percentage of net revenues for fiscal year 2009 when compared to fiscal year 2008 was principally attributable to the restructuring plan implemented on January 22, 2009 in which we exited non-core product areas.

Cash and cash equivalent balances increased $89.0 million to $453.3 million at October 1, 2010 from $364.2 million at October 2, 2009. Our net cash position, after deducting our short and long term debt, increased by $137.7 million to $378.5 million at October 1, 2010 from $240.8 million at October 2, 2009. Based on our historical results of operations, we expect our existing sources of liquidity, together with cash expected to be generated from operations, will be sufficient to fund our research and development, capital expenditures, debt obligations, working capital and other cash requirements for at least the next 12 months. However, we cannot be certain that the capital required to fund these expenses will be available in the future. In addition, any strategic investments and acquisitions that we may make may require additional capital resources. If we are unable to obtain sufficient capital to meet our capital needs on a timely basis and on favorable terms, our business and operations could be materially adversely affected.

Our products and markets are subject to continued technological advances. Recognizing the importance of such technological advances, we maintain a high level of research and development activities. We maintain close collaborative relationships with many of our customers to help identify market demands and target our development efforts to meet those demands. We are focusing our development efforts on new products, design tools and manufacturing processes using our core technologies. Our research and development expenditures for fiscal years ended October 2, 2009, October 3, 2008, and September 28, 2007 were $124.0 million, $146.0 million, and $126.1 million, respectively. The reduction in research and development expenditures between fiscal year 2008 and fiscal year 2009 was principally the result of the exit of non-core product areas in the second quarter of fiscal 2009.

During the fourth fiscal quarter of 2006, Skyworks began the restructuring of its business by discontinuing its baseband operations in order to sharpen focus on its high growth core business. Skyworks baseband product area developed complete reference designs, incorporating the digital signal processor and software functionality, in support of tier-three handset suppliers. This initiative was complex, research and development intensive and generated substantial operating losses. As tier-one OEMs increasingly dominate the landscape, the addressable market for the Companys baseband solutions had significantly contracted. As a result of this decision, Skyworks restructured its business to focus on its core analog and RF product markets.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
research and development
Our products and markets are subject to continued technological advances. Recognizing the importance of such technological advances, we maintain a high level of research and development activities. We maintain close collaborative relationships with many of our customers to help identify market demands and target our development efforts to meet those demands. Our design centers are strategically located around the world to be in close proximity to our customers and to take advantage of key technical and engineering talent worldwide. We are focusing our development efforts on new products, design tools and manufacturing processes using our core technologies. Our research and development expenditures for fiscal years ended September 29, 2006, September 30, 2005, and October 1, 2004 were $164.1 million, $152.2 million, and $152.6 million, respectively.
research and development
We cannot assure you that we will have sufficient resources to make the substantial investment in research and development needed to develop and bring to market new and enhanced products in a timely manner. We will be required to continually evaluate expenditures for planned product development and to choose among alternative technologies based on our expectations of future market growth. We cannot assure you that we will be able to develop and introduce new or enhanced wireless communications semiconductor products in a timely and cost-effective manner, that our products will satisfy customer requirements or achieve market acceptance or that we will be able to anticipate new industry standards and technological changes. We also cannot assure you that we will be able to respond successfully to new product announcements and introductions by competitors or to changes in the design or specifications of complementary products of third parties with which our products interface. If we fail to

After our product has been developed, tested and manufactured, our customers may need three to six months or longer to integrate, test and evaluate our product and an additional three to six months or more to begin volume production of equipment that incorporates the product. This lengthy cycle time increases the possibility that a customer may decide to cancel or change product plans, which could reduce or eliminate our sales to that customer. As a result of this lengthy sales cycle, we may incur significant research and development expenses, and selling, general and administrative expenses, before we generate the related revenues for these products. Furthermore, we may never generate the anticipated revenues from a product after incurring such expenses if our customer cancels or changes its product plans.
research and development
Based on our results of operations for fiscal 2006 and current trends, we expect our existing sources of liquidity, together with cash expected to be generated from operations and short term investments along with our ability to access financial markets for additional debt or equity financing, will allow us to sufficiently fund our research and development, capital expenditures, debt obligations (to replace existing or maturing debt instruments), purchase obligations, working capital and other cash requirements for at least the next 12 months. If necessary, among other alternatives, we may add lease lines of credit to finance capital expenditures and we may obtain other long-term debt, lines of credit and other financing.

We might obtain additional sources of financing in the future. Based on our results of operations for fiscal 2006 and current trends, we expect our existing sources of liquidity, together with cash expected to be generated from operations and short term investments along with our ability to access financial markets for additional debt or equity financing, will likely allow us to sufficiently fund our research and development, capital expenditures, debt obligations, purchase obligations, working capital and other cash requirements for at least the next 12 months. To the extent that existing cash and securities and cash from operations are insufficient to fund our future activities, we may need to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financing. Conditions existing in the U.S. capital markets, if and when we seek additional financing as well as the then current condition of the Company, will affect our ability to raise capital, as well as the terms of any such financing. We may not be able to raise enough capital to meet our capital needs on a timely basis or at all. Failure to obtain capital when required would have a material adverse effect on us.
research and development
Although we have in the past and intend to continue to invest significant resources in internal research and development activities, the complexity and rapidity of technological changes and the significant expense of internal research and development make it impractical for us to pursue development of all technological solutions on our own. On an ongoing basis, we intend to review investment, alliance and acquisition prospects that would complement our product offerings, augment our market coverage or enhance our technological capabilities. However, we cannot assure you that we will be able to identify and consummate suitable investment, alliance or acquisition transactions in the future. Moreover, if we consummate such transactions, they could result in:

The semiconductor and electronics industries have been subject to increasing environmental regulations. A number of domestic and foreign jurisdictions seek to restrict the use of various substances, a number of which have been used in our products or processes. For example, the European Union Restriction of Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment (RoHS) Directive now requires that certain substances be removed from all electronics components. Removing such substances requires the expenditure of additional research and development funds to seek alternative substances, as well as increased testing by third parties to ensure the quality of our products and compliance with the RoHS Directive. While we have implemented a compliance program to ensure our product offering meets these regulations, there may be instances where alternative substances will not be available or commercially feasible, or may only be available from a single source, or may be significantly more expensive than their restricted counterparts. Additionally, if we were found to be non-compliant with any such rule or regulation, we could be subject to fines, penalties and/or restrictions imposed by government agencies that could adversely affect our operating results.

The wireless communications semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and is characterized by rapid technological change, rapid product obsolescence and price erosion, evolving standards, short product life cycles and wide fluctuations in product supply and demand. In the past, average selling prices of established products have generally declined over time and this trend is expected to continue in the future. Our operating results have been, and our operating results may continue to be, negatively affected by substantial quarterly and annual fluctuations and market downturns due to a number of factors, such as changes in demand for end-user equipment, the timing of the receipt, reduction or cancellation of significant customer orders, the gain or loss of significant customers, market acceptance of our products and our customers products, our ability to develop, introduce and market new products and technologies on a timely basis, availability and cost of products from suppliers, new product and technology introductions by competitors, changes in the mix of products produced and sold, intellectual property disputes, the timing and extent of product development costs and general economic conditions. In addition, we may discover from time to time defects in our products after they have been shipped, which may require us to pay warranty claims, replace products, or pay costs associated with the recall of a customers products containing our parts.

At the end of the fourth fiscal quarter, Skyworks decided to immediately cease its baseband operations in order to sharpen focus on its high growth core business. Skyworks baseband product area developed complete reference designs, incorporating the digital signal processor and software functionality, in support of tier-three handset suppliers. This initiative was complex, research and development intensive and generated substantial operating losses. As tier-one OEMs increasingly dominate the landscape, the addressable market for the Companys baseband solutions had significantly contracted. As a result of this decision, Skyworks restructured its business to focus on its core analog and RF product markets.

Research and development expenses consist principally of direct personnel costs, costs for pre-production evaluation and testing of new devices, and design and test tool costs.
development cost
Although research and development expenses in fiscal 2006 increased when compared to fiscal 2005, we anticipate that we will achieve a reduction in research and development costs in future periods due to our exit of the baseband product area in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006. The aforementioned increase is primarily attributable to increased labor and benefit costs incurred to support our next generation multimode radios and precision analog semiconductors. We anticipate continued acceleration in the development and commercialization of our Helios EDGE (Enhanced Data rates for Global Evolution) radio, CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access) solutions and next generation front-end modules and power amplifiers with several of our top customers in fiscal 2007. The increase in research and development costs primarily supports new product introductions, as well as new product development, focused on diversifying our product portfolio within our Linear Products area outside of the cellular handset market. We also incurred $6.3 million in research and development related share-based compensation expense in fiscal 2006 related to our adoption of SFAS 123(R). No research and development related share-based compensation expense was recorded in fiscal 2005.

research and development
Research and development expenses in fiscal 2005 declined slightly when compared to fiscal 2004. The decline is principally due to decreased incentive compensation costs. We also reduced research and development expenditures in the baseband product area during this period as we focused our product development on core front-end modules, RF subsystems, infrastructure and next-generation solutions.

In addition, any strategic investments and acquisitions that we may make to help us grow our business may require additional capital resources. If we are unable to obtain enough capital to meet our capital needs on a timely basis or at all, our business and operations could be materially adversely affected.

In fiscal 2004, we generated $91.9 million in cash from operating activities. This was principally attributable to net revenues in fiscal 2004 of $784.0 million primarily resulting from increased demand for our wireless product portfolio. More specifically, we had launched a number of more highly integrated product offerings, added to our customer base and expanded our geographical market presence. In addition, we reduced research and development expenses and selling, general and administrative expense as a percentage of net revenues to 31.9% in fiscal 2004. During fiscal 2004, we invested $60.0 million in capital equipment primarily related to the design of new highly

In fiscal 2004, we generated $91.9 million in cash from operating activities as we experienced a significant improvement in our operating results when compared to the previous fiscal year. This improvement was primarily attributable to increased net revenues in fiscal 2004, when compared to the previous fiscal year, primarily resulting from increased demand for our wireless product portfolio. More specifically, we have launched a number of more highly integrated product offerings, added to our customer base and expanded our geographical market presence. In addition, we reduced research and development expenses and selling, general and administrative expense as a percentage of net revenues to 31.9% in fiscal 2004, from 39.1% for the previous fiscal year. During fiscal 2004, we invested $60.0 million in capital equipment primarily related to the design of new highly integrated products and processes, enabling us to address new opportunities and to meet our customers demands. We believe a focused program of capital expenditures will be required to sustain our current manufacturing capabilities. We may also consider acquisition opportunities to extend our technology portfolio and design expertise and to expand our product offerings. We expect our capital expenditures for fiscal 2005 to return to levels more comparable to fiscal 2003.

Cash used in operating activities was $72.1 million for fiscal 2003, reflecting a net loss of $451.4 million, offset by non-cash charges (primarily asset impairments, depreciation and amortization) of $489.2 million and a net decrease in working capital items of approximately $109.9 million, including $40.0 million of merger-related expense payments. As of September 30, 2003, substantially all amounts accrued for merger-related expenses had been paid. We adopted SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, on October 1, 2002, and recorded a $397.1 million charge for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, representing the difference between the implied fair value and carrying value of our goodwill. Operating results in fiscal 2003 improved when compared to fiscal 2002, primarily as the result of increased revenues and improved utilization of our manufacturing facilities. Cash used in operating activities was $99.1 million for fiscal 2002. Operating cash flows for fiscal 2002 reflect a net loss of $236.1 million, offset by non-cash charges (depreciation and amortization, asset impairments and an in-process research and development charge) of $221.6 million and a net increase in working capital of approximately $84.6 million. During 2002, we consolidated facilities, reduced our work force and continued to implement cost saving initiatives. In addition, increased revenues and improved utilization of our manufacturing facilities contributed to improved operating results in fiscal 2002.

Based on our results of operations for fiscal 2004 and current trends, we expect our existing sources of liquidity, together with cash expected to be generated from operations, will be sufficient to fund our research and development, capital expenditures, debt obligations, purchase obligations, working capital and other cash requirements for at least the next twelve months. However, we cannot assure you that the capital required to fund these expenses will be available in the future. In addition, any strategic investments and acquisitions that we may make to help us grow our business may require additional capital resources. If we are unable to obtain enough capital to meet our capital needs on a timely basis or at all, our business and operations could be materially adversely affected.

We cannot assure you that we will have sufficient resources to make the substantial investment in research and development needed to develop and bring to market new and enhanced products in a timely manner. We will be required to continually evaluate expenditures for planned product development and to choose among alternative technologies based on our expectations of future market growth. We cannot assure you that we will be able to develop and introduce new or enhanced wireless communications semiconductor products in a timely and cost-effective manner, that our products will satisfy customer requirements or achieve market acceptance or that we will be able to anticipate new industry standards and technological changes. We also cannot assure you that we will be able to respond successfully to new product announcements and introductions by competitors or to changes in the design or specifications of complementary products of third parties with which our products interface. If we fail to rapidly and cost-effectively introduce new and enhanced products in sufficient quantities and that meet our customers requirements, our business and results of operations would be materially and adversely harmed.

After our product has been developed, tested and manufactured, our customers may need three to six months or longer to integrate, test and evaluate our product and an additional three to six months or more to begin volume production of equipment that incorporates the product. This lengthy cycle time increases the possibility that a customer may decide to cancel or change product plans, which could reduce or eliminate our sales to that customer. As a result of this lengthy sales cycle, we may incur significant research and development expenses, and selling, general and administrative expenses, before we generate the related revenues for these products. Furthermore, we may never generate the anticipated revenues from a product after incurring such expenses if our customer cancels or changes its product plans.

We may need to obtain sources of financing in the future. We expect our existing sources of liquidity, together with cash expected to be generated from operations, will be sufficient to fund our research and development, capital expenditures, debt obligations, purchase obligations, working capital and other cash requirements for at least the next twelve months. However, we cannot assure you that the capital required to fund these expenses will be available in the future. To the extent that existing cash and securities and cash from operations are insufficient to fund our future activities, we may need to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financing. Conditions existing in the U.S. capital markets if and when we seek additional financing as well as the then current condition of the Company will affect our ability to raise capital, as well as the terms of any such financing. We may not be able to raise enough capital to meet our capital needs on a timely basis or at all. Failure to obtain capital when required would have a material adverse effect on the Company.

The financial statements for the periods prior to the Merger also include allocations of certain Conexant operating expenses for research and development, legal, accounting, treasury, human resources, real estate, information systems, distribution, customer service, sales, marketing, engineering and other corporate services provided by Conexant, including executive salaries and other costs. The operating expense allocations have been determined on bases that management considered to be reasonable reflections of the utilization of services provided to, or the benefit received by, Washington/Mexicali. Management believes that the expenses allocated to Washington/Mexicali are representative of the operating expenses that would have been incurred had Washington/Mexicali operated as an independent company. Since the date of the Merger, the Company has been performing these functions using its own resources or purchased services, including certain services obtained from Conexant pursuant to a transition services agreement, most of which expired on December 31, 2002. The Company transitioned the remaining services from Conexant to third party providers during the third quarter of fiscal 2004.

The following unaudited pro forma financial information presents the consolidated operations of the Company as if the June 25, 2002 Merger had occurred as of the beginning of the periods presented. This information gives effect to certain adjustments including increased amortization of intangibles and increased interest expense related to debt issued in conjunction with the Merger. In-process research and development of $65.5 million and other Merger-related expenses of $28.8 million have been excluded from the pro forma results as they are non-recurring and not indicative of normal operating results. This information is provided for illustrative purposes only, and is not necessarily indicative of the operating results that would have occurred had the Merger been consummated at the beginnings of the periods presented, nor is it necessarily indicative of any future operating results.
research and development
In connection with the Merger, $65.5 million was allocated to purchased in-process research and development and expensed immediately upon completion of the acquisition (as a charge not deductible for tax purposes) because the technological feasibility of certain products under development had not been established and no future alternative uses existed.
r&d
The material risks associated with the successful completion of the in-process technology were associated with our ability to successfully finish the creation of viable prototypes and successful design of the chips, masks and manufacturing processes required. We expected to benefit from the in-process projects as the individual products that contained the in-process technology were put into production and sold to end-users. The release dates for each of the products within the product families were varied. The fair value of the in-process research and development (IPR&D) was determined using the income approach. Under the income approach, the fair value reflected the present value of the projected cash flows that were expected to be generated by the products incorporating the IPR&D, if successful. The projected cash flows were discounted to approximate fair value. The discount rate applicable to the cash flows of each project reflected the stage of completion and other risks inherent in each project. The weighted average discount rate used in the valuation of IPR&D was 30 percent. The Company had either completed or abandoned each of these projects prior to the completion of fiscal 2003. The completed IPR&D projects commenced generating cash flows in fiscal 2003. Due to the nature of these projects and the related technology, the revenue streams derived from these projects cannot be separately identified. The Company decided to abandon the projects noted as such below because of continuing technology problems, downturn in demand, major delays and insufficient technical features for the competitive marketplace. The Company does not believe that its decision to abandon any of the projects listed below individually or in the aggregate had a material effect on its results of operations.

In fiscal 2002 and fiscal 2000, the Company recorded purchased in-process research and development charges of $65.5 million and $24.4 million, respectively, related to the Merger and the acquisition of Philsar Semiconductor Inc., respectively.
development cost
The wireless communications semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and is characterized by constant and rapid technological change, rapid product obsolescence and price erosion, evolving standards, short product life cycles and wide fluctuations in product supply and demand. Our operating results have been, and our operating results may continue to be, negatively affected by substantial quarterly and annual fluctuations and market downturns due to a number of factors, such as changes in demand for end-user equipment, the timing of the receipt, reduction or cancellation of significant customer orders, the gain or loss of significant customers, market acceptance of our products and our customers products, our ability to develop, introduce and market new products and technologies on a timely basis, availability and cost of products from suppliers, new product and technology introductions by competitors, changes in the mix of products produced and sold, intellectual property disputes, the timing and extent of product development costs and general economic conditions. In the past, average selling prices of established products have generally declined over time and this trend is expected to continue in the future.

Purchased in-process research and development
research and development
Research and development expenses consist principally of direct personnel costs, costs for pre-production evaluation and testing of new devices and design and test tool costs. Research and development expenses for the periods prior to the Merger also include allocated costs for shared research and development services provided by Conexant, principally in the areas of advanced semiconductor process development, design automation and advanced package development, for the benefit of several of Conexants businesses.
research and development
The increase in research and development expenses in fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002 represents our commitment to design new products and processes and address new opportunities to meet our customers demands. We have expanded customer support engagements as well as development efforts targeting semiconductor solutions using the CDMA2000, GSM, General Packet Radio Services, or GPRS, and third-generation, or 3G, wireless standards in both the digital cellular handset and infrastructure markets. The increase in research and development expenses in fiscal 2003 when compared to the previous year is also related to our research and development expenses representing those of the combined company after the Merger whereas those expenses in 2002 are representative of only Washington/Mexicali prior to June 25, 2002.
research and development
The increase in research and development expenses in fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001 primarily reflects the opening of a new design center in Le Mans, France and higher headcount and personnel-related costs. Subsequent to the first quarter of fiscal 2001, we expanded customer support engagements as well as development efforts targeting semiconductor solutions using the CDMA2000, GSM, GPRS, and 3G wireless standards in both the digital cellular handset and infrastructure markets.

The weighted average discount rate used in the valuation of IPR&D was 30 percent. As of September 30, 2003, the Company had either completed or abandoned each of these projects. The completed IPR&D projects commenced generating cash flows in fiscal 2003. Due to the nature of these projects and the related technolgy, the revenue streams derived from these projects cannot be separately identified.
research and development
Cash used in operating activities was $99.1 million and $89.4 million for fiscal 2002 and 2001, respectively. Operating cash flows for fiscal 2002 and 2001 reflect net losses of $236.1 million and $318.9 million, respectively, offset by non-cash charges (depreciation and amortization, asset impairments and an in-process research and development charge) of $221.6 million and $220.8 million, respectively, and a net increase in working capital of approximately $84.6 million and a net decrease of $8.7 million, respectively. During 2002 we consolidated facilities, reduced our work force and continued to implement cost saving initiatives. In addition, increased revenues and improved utilization of our manufacturing facilities contributed to improved operating results in fiscal 2002 when compared to fiscal 2001.
research and development
Based on our fiscal 2003 results of operations and current trends, and after giving effect to the net proceeds we received in our private placement of 4.75 percent convertible subordinated notes due 2007, our debt refinancing with Conexant, our common stock public offering and our Facility Agreement, we expect our existing sources of liquidity, together with cash expected to be generated from operations, will be sufficient to fund our research and development, capital expenditures, debt obligations, purchase obligations, working capital and other cash requirements for at least the next twelve months.
research and development
We cannot assure you that we will have sufficient resources to make the substantial investment in research and development needed to develop and bring to market new and enhanced products in a timely manner. We will be required to continually evaluate expenditures for planned product development and to choose among alternative technologies based on our expectations of future market growth. We cannot assure you that we will be able to develop and introduce new or enhanced wireless communications semiconductor products in a timely and cost-effective manner, that our products will satisfy customer requirements or achieve market acceptance or that we will be able to anticipate new industry standards and technological changes. We also cannot assure you that we will be able to respond successfully to new product announcements and introductions by competitors or to changes in the design or specifications of complementary products of third parties to which our products interface.
research and development
After our product is has been developed, tested, and manufactured, our customers may need three to six months or longer to integrate, test and evaluate our products and an additional three to six months or more to begin volume production of equipment incorporates the products. This lengthy cycle time increases the possibility that a customer may decide to cancel or change product plans, which could reduce or eliminate our sales to that customer. As a result of this lengthy sales cycle, we may incur significant research and development expenses, and selling, general and administrative expenses, before we generate the related revenues for these products. Furthermore, we may never generate the anticipated revenues from a product after incurring such expenses if our customer cancels or changes its product plans.
research and development
We will need to obtain sources of financing in the future. After giving effect to the net proceeds of our $102 million offering on or about September 12, 2003, our $230 million private placement of 4.75 percent convertible subordinated notes due 2007, our $45 million debt refinancing with Conexant and our receivables financing credit facility with Wachovia Bank, National Association, we believe that our existing sources of liquidity, together with cash expected to be generated from operations, will be sufficient to fund our research and development, capital expenditure, working capital and other financing requirements for at least the next twelve months.
research and development
Although we intend to invest significant resources in internal research and development activities, the complexity and rapidity of technological changes and the significant expense of internal research and development make it impractical for us to pursue development of all technological solutions on our own. On an ongoing basis, we intend to review investment, alliance and acquisition prospects that would complement our product offerings, augment our market coverage or enhance our technological capabilities. However, we cannot assure you that we will be able to identify and consummate suitable investment, alliance or acquisition transactions in the future. Moreover, if we consummate such transactions, they could result in:

The increase in research and development expenses in fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001 primarily reflects the opening of a new design center in Le Mans, France and higher headcount and personnel-related costs. Subsequent to the first quarter of fiscal 2001, we expanded customer support engagements as well as development efforts targeting semiconductor solutions using the CDMA2000, GSM, General Packet Radio Services, or GPRS, and third-generation, or 3G, wireless standards in both the digital cellular handset and infrastructure markets.
research and development
During fiscal 2001, the Company focused its research and development investment principally on wireless communications applications such as next generation power amplifiers, radio frequency subsystems and cellular systems. In particular, the Company has focused a significant amount of research and development resources in developing complete network protocol stacks and user interface software in support of its cellular systems initiative. The increase in research and development expenses for fiscal 2001 primarily reflects higher headcount and personnel-related costs to support the Company's expanded development efforts and the accelerated launch of new products. The higher fiscal 2001 research and development expenses also include costs of approximately $5.6 million resulting from the acquisition of Philsar in fiscal 2000.

The material risks associated with the successful completion of the in-process technology are associated with the Company's ability to successfully finish the creation of viable prototypes and successful design of the chips, masks and manufacturing processes required. The Company expects to benefit from the in-process projects as the individual products that contain the in-process technology are put into production and sold to end-users. The release dates for each of the products within the product families are varied. The fair value of the in-process research and development was determined using the income approach. Under the income approach, the fair value reflects the present value of the projected cash flows that are expected to be generated by the products incorporating the in-process research and development, if successful.

Cash used in operating activities was $99.1 million for fiscal 2002, reflecting a net loss of $236.1 million, offset by non-cash charges (depreciation and amortization, asset impairments and an in-process research and development charge) of $216.6 million and a net increase in the non-cash components of working capital of approximately $79.6 million. During 2002 the Company consolidated facilities, reduced its work force and continued to implement cost saving initiatives. In addition, increased revenues and improved utilization of our manufacturing facilities contributed to improved operating results in fiscal 2002.
research and development
Cash used in operating activities was $89.4 million and $53.8 million for fiscal 2001 and 2000, respectively. Operating cash flows for fiscal 2001 and 2000 reflect net losses of $318.9 million and $66.5 million, respectively, offset by non-cash charges (depreciation and amortization, asset impairments and an in-process research and development charge) of $220.8 million and $98.1 million, respectively, and a net decrease in the non-cash components of working capital of approximately $8.7 million and a net increase of $85.4 million, respectively.

We cannot assure you that we will have sufficient resources to make the substantial investment in research and development in order to develop and bring to market new and enhanced products in a timely manner. We will be required continually to evaluate expenditures for planned product development and to choose among alternative technologies based on our expectations of future market growth. We cannot assure you that we will be able to develop and introduce new or enhanced wireless communications semiconductor products in a timely and cost-effective manner, that our products will satisfy customer requirements or achieve market acceptance or that we will be able to anticipate new industry standards and technological changes. We also cannot assure you that we will be able to respond successfully to new product announcements and introductions by competitors.
research and development
Our customers may need three to six months to test and evaluate our products and an additional three to six months to begin volume production of equipment that incorporates our products. The lengthy period of time required increases the possibility that a customer may decide to cancel or change product plans, which could reduce or eliminate our sales to that customer. As a result of this lengthy sales cycle, we may incur significant research and development, and selling, general and administrative expenses before we generate the related revenues for these products, and we may never generate the anticipated revenues if our customer cancels or changes its product plans.
research and development
We may need to obtain sources of financing in the future. After giving effect to the net proceeds we received in our private placement of 4.75 percent convertible subordinated notes due 2007 and our debt refinancing with Conexant, we believe that our existing sources of liquidity, together with cash expected to be generated from operations, will be sufficient to fund our research and development, capital expenditure, working capital and other financing requirements for at least the next twelve months.

Although we intend to invest significant resources in internal research and development activities, the complexity and rapidity of technological changes and the significant expense of internal research and development make it impractical for us to pursue development of all technological solutions on our own. On an ongoing basis, we intend to review investment, alliance and acquisition prospects that would complement our product offerings, augment our market coverage or enhance our technological capabilities. However, we cannot assure you that we will be able to identify and consummate suitable investment, alliance or acquisition transactions in the future.

Goodwill and intangible assets are principally the result of the Merger with Washington/Mexicali completed on June 25, 2002 and a business acquisition completed in fiscal 2000. The Company adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 141, Business Combinations as of July 1, 2001. Goodwill and intangible assets determined to have an indefinite useful life acquired in a purchase business combination completed after June 30, 2001, but before SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, is adopted in full, are not amortized. Goodwill and intangible assets acquired in business combinations completed before July 1, 2001 continued to be amortized. Business acquisitions are accounted for by assigning the purchase price to tangible and intangible assets and liabilities, including purchased in-process research and development (IPRD) projects, which have not yet reached technological feasibility and have no alternative future use. Assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their estimated fair values; the excess of the purchase price over the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. The value of IPRD is immediately charged to expense upon completion of the acquisition. Developed technology, customer relationships and other intangibles are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives (principally 10 years).

To the extent that Washington/Mexicali had filed separate tax returns as of September 30, 2001, the U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards would have been approximately $316.3 million, which would expire at various dates through 2021, and aggregate state net operating loss carryforwards would have been approximately $295.3 million, which would expire at various dates through 2011. Washington/Mexicali would also have had U.S. Federal and state research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately $11.5 million and $5.4 million, respectively. The U.S. Federal tax credits would expire at various dates through 2021, while the state credits would have no expiration date. California Manufacturers' Investment Credits of approximately $4.8 million would expire at various dates through 2009. These tax attributes include certain amounts that were retained by Conexant and are not available to be utilized in the separate tax returns of the combined company subsequent to the Merger and the combined company's purchase of the Mexicali Operations.

Our products and markets are subject to continued technological advances. Recognizing this, we maintain a high level of research and development activities to remain competitive in certain areas and to be an industry leader in other areas. We maintain close collaborative relationships with many of our customers to help identify market demands and target our development efforts to meet those demands. We are focusing our development efforts on new products, design tools and manufacturing processes in our semiconductor products segment using our core technologies.
r&d
Our R&D expenditures for fiscal 2002, 2001 and 2000 were $41.6 million, $36.0 million and $25.3 million, respectively.

Research and Development Expenses. Research and development expenses increased 15.4% to $41.6 million or 32.9% of net sales in fiscal 2002 from $36.0 million or 13.3% of net sales in fiscal 2001. Included in the $41.6 million is approximately $2.5 million related to the write-off of in-process research and development and amortization of intangible assets associated with our March 2002 purchase of Aimta, Inc., a developer of Low Temperature Co-fired Ceramics (LTCC) for wireless handsets. Excluding this charge, research and development expenses for fiscal 2002 would have totaled $39.1 million or 30.9% of net sales, an increase of 8.5% compared to fiscal 2001. The increase in research and development expenses is the result of our commitment to design new products and processes and address new opportunities to meet our customers' demands. This sustained effort to meet our customers' changing product requirements is highlighted by our focus on the migration from individual chips to integrated radio frequency module solutions.

development expenses increased 42.2% to $36.0 million or 13.3% of net sales in fiscal 2001 from $25.3 million or 13.6% of net sales in fiscal 2000. The increase in research and development expenses was primarily attributable to our ongoing development of processes and applications within our Semiconductor Products segment in order to address our targeted markets: wireless and broadband.

In-Process Research and Development. The following table summarizes the significant assumptions underlying the valuation of in-process research and development for the Aimta, Inc. acquisition:
r&d
IPR&D ESTIMATED COST TO DISCOUNT FISCAL 2002: CHARGE COMPLETE TECHNOLOGY RATE ------------ ------ ------------------- -------- (in thousands)
research and development
The amount charged to in-process research and development related to one project and represents the estimated fair value based upon risk-adjusted cash flows related to the incomplete project. This project was approximately 80% complete as of the date of acquisition. As of the date of the acquisition, the development of this project had not reached technological feasibility and the research and development in progress had no alternative future use. Accordingly, this cost was expensed at the acquisition date.
research and development
(Benefit) Provision for Income Taxes. The benefit for income taxes in fiscal 2002 was $9.0 million compared to a provision for income taxes of $15.9 million in fiscal 2001. The fiscal 2002 benefit reflects a tax rate of approximately 33% compared to a tax rate of 32% in fiscal 2001. The increase in the fiscal 2002 tax rate is primarily due to a decrease in the utilization of research and development tax credits during fiscal 2002. The provision for income taxes in fiscal 2001 was $15.9 million compared to $9.3 million in fiscal 2000. The fiscal 2001 provision reflects a tax rate of approximately 32% compared to a tax rate of 34% in fiscal 2000.
research and development
The decrease in the fiscal 2001 tax rate is primarily the result of research and development tax credits utilized in fiscal 2001.
research and development
Operating (loss) income for the Semiconductor Products segment decreased to an operating loss of $28.1 million in fiscal 2002 compared to operating income of $35.3 million in fiscal 2001. The decline was primarily the result of lower revenue, underutilization of capacity and the continued investment in research and development during fiscal 2002. Operating income for the Semiconductor Products segment increased 99.8% to $35.3 million in fiscal 2001 from $16.8 million in fiscal 2000. The increase was primarily attributable to increased sales and improved operating efficiencies as this segment continued to leverage capacity, improve yields and control selling and administrative costs.
research and development
As of March 31, 2002, we had working capital of $136.3 million, including $114.1 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. Annualized inventory turns decreased to 7.3 in fiscal 2002 compared to 9.7 in fiscal 2001. Additionally, days sales outstanding included in accounts receivable for fiscal 2002 increased to 71 days compared to 50 days in fiscal 2002. We continued to manage our working capital during the downturn in the wireless communications and broadband markets. We reduced inventory levels and managed our investment in capital expenditures, while maintaining our commitment to investment in research and development and maintaining our manufacturing capability.
research and development
A number of our competitors have combined with each other and consolidated their businesses, including the consolidation of competitors with our customers. This consolidation is attributable to a number of factors, including the historically high-growth nature of the communications electronics industry and the time-to-market pressures on suppliers to decrease the time required for product conception, research and development, sampling and production launch before a product reaches the market. This consolidation trend is expected to continue, since investments, alliances and acquisitions may enable semiconductor suppliers, including us and our competitors, to achieve economies of scale, to augment technical capabilities or to achieve faster time-to-market for their products than would be possible solely through internal development.

We cannot assure you that we will have sufficient resources to make the substantial investment in research and development in order to develop and bring to market new and enhanced products in a timely manner. We will be required continually to evaluate expenditures for planned product development and to choose among alternative technologies based on our expectations of future market growth. We cannot assure you that we will be able to develop and introduce new or enhanced wireless communications semiconductor products in a timely and cost-effective manner, that our products will satisfy customer requirements or achieve market acceptance or that we will be able to anticipate new industry standards and technological changes. We also cannot assure you that we will be able to respond successfully to new product announcements and introductions by competitors.
research and development
BECAUSE OF THE LENGTHY SALES CYCLES OF MANY OF OUR PRODUCTS, WE MAY INCUR SIGNIFICANT EXPENSES BEFORE WE GENERATE ANY REVENUES RELATED TO THOSE PRODUCTS. Our customers may need three to six months to test and evaluate our products and an additional three to six months to begin volume production of equipment that incorporates our products. The lengthy period of time required increases the possibility that a customer may decide to cancel or change product plans, which could reduce or eliminate our sales to that customer. As a result of this lengthy sales cycle, we may incur significant research and development, and selling, general and administrative expenses before we generate the related revenues for these products, and we may never generate the anticipated revenues if our customer cancels or changes its product plans.

As of March 31, 2002, the Company has available for income tax purposes approximately $51.6 million in federal net operating loss carryforwards (NOLs). NOLs of approximately $7.6 million relate to operating losses of NDI, which was acquired on April 24, 2000. These losses are subject to an annual limitation and begin to expire in fiscal year 2018. In addition, the Company has federal alternative minimum tax credits, state tax credit carryforwards and state tax NOL carryforwards of approximately $865,000, $1 million and $2.9 million, respectively, that are available to reduce future federal and state regular income taxes over an indefinite period. The Company also has research and development credits of approximately $2.6 million that will begin to expire in fiscal year 2012. The Company has established a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets which may not be realized due to the expiration of certain state tax net operating losses. The valuation allowance for deferred tax assets as of March 31, 2002 and April 1, 2001 was $2.1 million and $1.9 million, respectively. The net change in the total valuation allowance for the years ended March 31, 2002 and April 1, 2001 was an increase of $255,000 and $1.0 million, respectively. The Company believes that it is more likely than not that future taxable income will be sufficient to fully utilize the remaining deferred tax assets.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
r&d
Our products and markets are subject to continued technological advances. Recognizing this, we maintain a high level of R&D activities to remain competitive in certain areas and to be an industry leader in other areas. We maintain close collaborative relationships with many of our customers to help us identify market demands and target our development efforts to meet those demands. We are focusing our development efforts on new products, design tools and manufacturing processes in our Semiconductor Products segment using our core technologies. We strive to improve existing product performance, improve design and manufacturing processes and reduce costs. The introduction of our aiIP technique and Alpha-2 multi-chip

module packaging technology during fiscal 2001 is evidence of our focus in this area. Further evidence of our commitment to R&D is our introduction of the world's first tri-band power amplifier module employing InGaP HBT process technology and the introduction of breakthrough switch/filter technology for wireless handsets. The switch/filter products combine multiple functions in a single, module-based platform and utilize our aiIP technique.

Research and Development Expenses. Research and development expenses increased 42.2% to $36.0 million or 13.3% of sales in fiscal 2001 from $25.3 million or 13.6% of sales in fiscal 2000. The increase in research and development expenses is primarily attributable to our ongoing development of processes and applications within our Semiconductor Products segment in order to address our targeted markets: wireless and broadband. More than 90% of our total research and development spending in fiscal 2001 was within the Semiconductor Products segment. Research and development expenses increased 58.9% to $25.3 million or 13.6% of sales in fiscal 2000 from $15.9 million or 12.6% of sales in fiscal 1999. The increase in research and development expenses was primarily attributable to the development of processes and applications in the Semiconductor Products segment.

Provision (Benefit) for Income Taxes. The provision for income taxes in fiscal 2001 was $15.9 million compared to $9.3 million in fiscal 2000. The fiscal 2001 provision reflects a tax rate of approximately 32% compared to a tax rate of 34% in fiscal 2000. The decrease in the fiscal 2001 tax rate is primarily the result of research and development tax credits utilized in fiscal 2001. The $2.6 million benefit reflected in fiscal 1999 reflects a 10% tax rate offset by a $3.3 million tax benefit. The tax benefit of $3.3 million resulted from a reduction in the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets because of the expected use of net operating loss carryforwards in future periods.

The valuation allowance for deferred tax assets as of April 1, 2001 and April 2, 2000 was $1.9 million and $870,000, respectively. The net change in the total valuation allowance for the years ended April 1, 2001 and April 2, 2000 was an increase of $1.0 million and $40,000, respectively. The increase in the valuation allowance during fiscal 2001 reflects the estimated amount of deferred tax asset which may not be realized due to the expiration of state net operating loss carryforwards. As of April 1, 2001, the Company has available for income tax purposes approximately $8.2 million in federal net operating loss carryforwards (NOLs). The NOLs relate to operating losses of NDI, which was acquired on April 24, 2000. These losses are subject to an annual limitation and begin to expire in fiscal year 2019. In addition, the Company has minimum federal and state tax credit carryforwards of approximately $699,000 and $870,000 respectively, that are available to reduce future federal and state regular income taxes over an indefinite period. The Company also has research and development credits of approximately $1.9 million that will begin to expire in fiscal year 2012.

- DUROS-registered trademark- Implant Technology - DUROS human implant technology is designed to enable the delivery of therapeutic agents, including potent small molecules, peptides, proteins, DNA and other bioactive macromolecules, for periods of one month to one year. DUROS systems use an osmotic engine approach, similar to that used in OROS systems. Products incorporating DUROS implant technology have the potential to deliver drugs to subcutaneous sites for systemic therapy or to specific tissues. The Viadur-trademark- product, discussed in the following section, is the first DUROS product to reach the market. ALZA licensed certain uses of its DUROS technology to DURECT Corporation ("DURECT") for the development of DUROS products in five specified fields, primarily involving site-specific drug delivery. DURECT has an agreement with ALZA under which ALZA Technologies may perform research and development relating to such products for DURECT.
development cost
- Development Agreement: ALZA conducted product development activities for Crescendo. Development costs were billed to Crescendo on a product-by-product basis under terms consistent with arrangements with other partner companies. Under the Development Agreement, Crescendo funded the development of Ditropan XL- registered trademark-, Viadur-trademark- and Concerta-trademark- as well as other products.

Research and Development Revenues and Expenditures
research and development
ALZA had research and development revenues of $100.1 million during 2000, $120.8 million during 1999 and $124.4 million during 1998, from companies with which ALZA had development agreements. These amounts included revenues from Crescendo of $68.3 million in 2000, $90.5 million in 1999 and $95.0 million in 1998. Research and development revenue generally represents partner companies' reimbursement of costs, including a portion of general and administrative expenses. Therefore, product development activities do not contribute significantly to operating results. For research and development revenues by segment, see Note 14 of the Notes to ALZA's Consolidated Financial Statements referred to in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
development cost
ALZA spent $123.7 million on partner-sponsored product development activities during 2000, $123.9 million in 1999 and $113.0 million in 1998. Such amounts exclude reimbursable general and administrative costs. ALZA spent $67.1 million on internal research and development activities during 2000 ($59.7 million in 1999 and $69.8 million in 1998), also excluding allocable general and administrative costs. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred.

research and development
As the pharmaceutical industry continues to consolidate, and as pressures increase for cost-effective research and development, some pharmaceutical companies have reduced, and may continue to reduce, their funding of research and development. Competition for limited development funding may therefore increase, and this competition could include the partner companies' internal research and development programs, other drug delivery programs and other technologies and products of third parties. Similarly, as pharmaceutical companies search to fill gaps in their product pipelines with in-licensed or acquired products, ALZA Pharmaceuticals will be competing for product in-licensing and acquisition opportunities with companies with far greater financial and other resources than ALZA.
development cost
A major challenge faced by ALZA and other pharmaceutical companies is competition from generic pharmaceutical manufacturers. Generic competitors generally are able to obtain regulatory approval for off-patent drugs without investing in costly and time- consuming clinical trials, and need only demonstrate bioequivalence to the drug they wish to copy. Because of their substantially reduced development costs, generic companies are often able to charge much lower prices for their products than the originator of a new product. A number of products developed by ALZA Technologies incorporate chemical entities that are not covered by patents. These products therefore may be subject to potential generic competition to the extent that competitors can demonstrate bioequivalence without infringing ALZA patents relating to its drug delivery technologies or to other aspects of the products.
research and development
On December 31, 2000, ALZA had 2,442 employees, of whom approximately 800 were working in sales and marketing activities, approximately 700 in manufacturing, approximately 600 in research and development, and the remainder in general and administrative areas. ALZA does not have any union contracts, and believes that its relations with its employees are generally good.
development cost
The rate of patient enrollment sometimes delays completion of clinical studies. There is substantial competition to enroll patients in clinical trials for oncology products, and such competition has delayed clinical development of our products in the past. Delays in planned patient enrollment can result in increased development costs and delays in regulatory approval.
development cost
Generic competitors generally are able to obtain regulatory approval for drugs no longer covered by patents without investing in costly and time-consuming clinical trials, and need only demonstrate that their product is equivalent to the drug they wish to copy. Because of their substantially reduced development costs, generic companies are often able to charge much lower prices for their products than the original developer of a new product. Several generic companies have received approval to market generic versions of the ALZA-developed Procardia XL product, and there is now generic competition in the market. This generic competition will significantly reduce ALZA's royalties from this product. A number of ALZA's products incorporate chemical entities that are not covered by patents, and may be subject to competition from generic drugs.
research and development
ALZA's corporate offices are located in Mountain View, California, and its research and development campuses are in Mountain View and Menlo Park, California, with some facilities in Palo Alto, California. The three facilities in Menlo Park currently have leases expiring in 3 to 10 years. Most of the facilities in Palo Alto are held under prepaid ground leases from Stanford University that expire in approximately 14 to 57 years. One Palo Alto facility is subleased to ALZA. ALZA owns an undeveloped parcel in Minnesota. ALZA's large-scale commercial manufacturing facility, which is owned by ALZA, is located in Vacaville, California.

We own or have access to a finite amount of oil and gas reserves, which will be depleted over time. Replacement of oil and gas production and reserves, including proved undeveloped reserves, is subject to successful exploration drilling, development activities, and enhanced recovery programs. Therefore, future oil and gas production is dependent on technical success in finding and developing additional hydrocarbon reserves. Exploration activity involves the interpretation of seismic and other geological and geophysical data, which does not always successfully predict the presence of commercial quantities of hydrocarbons. Drilling risks include unexpected adverse conditions, irregularities in pressure or formations, equipment failure, blowouts and weather interruptions. Future developments may be affected by unforeseen reservoir conditions, which negatively affect recovery factors or flow rates. Reserve replacement can also be achieved through acquisition. Similar risks, however, may be encountered in the production of oil and gas on properties acquired from others. In addition to the technical risks to reserve replacement, replacing reserves and developing future production is also influenced by the price of crude oil and natural gas and costs of drilling and development activities. Lower crude oil and natural gas prices, may have the effect of reducing capital available for exploration and development activity and may render certain development projects uneconomic or delay their completion and may result in negative revisions to existing reserves while increasing drilling and development costs could negatively affect expected economic returns.

We own or have access to a finite amount of oil and gas reserves, which will be depleted over time. Replacement of oil and gas production and reserves, including proved undeveloped reserves, is subject to successful exploration drilling, development activities, and enhanced recovery programs. Therefore, future oil and gas production is dependent on technical success in finding and developing additional hydrocarbon reserves. Exploration activity involves the interpretation of seismic and other geological and geophysical data, which does not always successfully predict the presence of commercial quantities of hydrocarbons. Drilling risks include unexpected adverse conditions, irregularities in pressure or formations, equipment failure, blowouts and weather interruptions. Future developments may be affected by unforeseen reservoir conditions, which negatively affect recovery factors or flow rates. Reserve replacement can also be achieved through acquisition.

The Corporation and its partners have discovered significant crude oil and natural gas resources on the Stabroek Block, offshore Guyana, which will require substantial capital and time to fully develop. As a result of these discovered fields, which are expected to have a lower development cost than other assets in our portfolio, we have changed the priorities of our future investment plans, and have divested of higher cost, mature assets to provide funds toward future development of Guyana. In addition, we have announced plans to reduce debt and repurchase common stock.

Depreciation, depletion and amortization charges increased by $548 million in 2012 and $83 million in 2011, compared with the corresponding amounts in prior years. The increase in 2012 was primarily due to higher volumes and per barrel costs. The increase in 2011 was primarily due to higher per barrel costs, reflecting higher finding and development costs. In addition, the higher per barrel rates in 2012 and 2011 were largely due to greater production contribution from unconventional assets.

Includes an after-tax gain of $60 million ($97 million before income taxes) on termination of an acquisition, partially offset by a $24 million ($38 million before income taxes) charge for costs associated with a research and development venture.
development cost
Exploration and production earnings included after-tax asset impairments of $737 million, $530 million of which related to the Ceiba Field in Equatorial Guinea. The pre-tax amount of the Ceiba Field impairment was $706 million. The charge resulted from a 12% reduction in the estimated total field reserves that will ultimately be produced from the field, as well as higher anticipated development costs needed to produce the remaining reserves at lower production rates over a longer period. The reduction in estimated recoverable reserves was attributable to disappointing 2002 year-end drilling results on the western flank of the field. The reduction in probable reserves and higher estimated future development costs resulted in an asset impairment because projected cash flows were less than the book value of the field, which includes allocated purchase price from the Triton acquisition.
development cost
Accounting for Exploration and Development Costs:
development cost
The Corporations impairment tests of long-lived exploration and production producing assets are based on its best estimates of future production volumes (including recovery factors), selling prices, operating and capital costs and the timing of future production, which are updated each time an impairment test is performed. In 2002, the Corporation recorded impairments of the Ceiba Field and LLOG properties that were required primarily because of reduced estimates of oil and gas production volumes and, in the case of Ceiba, anticipated additional development costs. The impairment charges did not result from changes in the other factors. The change in the estimated timing of production on the Ceiba Field did not significantly affect the undiscounted future cash flows, but did significantly reduce the fair value of the field determined by discounted cash flows. The Corporation could have additional impairments if the projected production volumes from oil and gas fields were reduced. Significant extended declines in crude oil and natural gas selling prices could also result in asset impairments.

The Corporation recorded an impairment charge of $706 million relating to the Ceiba field in Equatorial Guinea. The charge resulted from a reduction in probable reserves of approximately 12% of total field reserves, as well as the additional development costs of producing these reserves over a longer field life. Fair value was determined by discounting anticipated future net cash flows. The Corporation also recorded an impairment charge of $318 million to reduce the carrying value of oil and gas properties located primarily in the Main Pass/Breton Sound area of the Gulf of Mexico. Most of these properties were obtained in the 2001 LLOG acquisition and consisted of producing oil and gas fields with proved and probable reserves and exploration acreage. This charge principally reflects reduced reserve estimates on these fields resulting from unfavorable production performance. The fair values of producing properties were determined by using discounted cash flows. Exploration properties were evaluated by using results of drilling and production data from nearby fields and seismic data for these and other properties in the area. These charges were recorded in the caption asset impairments in the income statement.

We carry identifiable intangibles, principally tradenames, that are subject to amortization over their estimated useful life, either 15 or 30 years, based on the assessment of a number of factors that may impact useful life. These factors include historical and tradename performance with respect to consumer name recognition, geographic market presence, market share, plans for ongoing tradename support and promotion, financial results and other relevant factors. The gross carrying value and accumulated amortization of amortizable intangible assets were $677.2 million and $146.9 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2004, compared to $508.9 million and $136.1 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2003. The gross carrying value increase was principally due to the recognition of amortizable identifiable intangible assets previously included in goodwill for the acquisition of Therma-Tru ($253.9 million), partly offset by the reclassification of a tradename as the result of heightened consumer name recognition in recent years due to increased and ongoing plans for tradename promotion, successful product research and development efforts and plans for continued investment, and favorable consumer perceptions regarding product quality and innovation ($85.6 million). During the twelve months ended December 31, 2003, the Company recorded a write-down of identifiable intangibles of $12.0 million ($8.0 million after tax) in discontinued operations to recognize the diminished values of certain trade names in our Office business.

Competitors with significant brand awareness have introduced golf balls into their product offerings in the past two years. The combined share of Titleist and Pinnacle in the domestic golf ball market fell approximately 2% in 2000. It is not possible to predict what long-term effect these new entrants or their impact on trade inventories will have on our business, but significant research and development and marketing expenditures to defend market share will continue.

In July 1997, the Company acquired a controlling interest in Presis, L.L.C. ("Presis") and subsequently purchased the minority interests from the former owners in 1998. Presis is a start-up business involved in developing technical advances in dry particle processing. The Company defines dry particle processing as a process of preparing compounds, such as pigments, for incorporation into manufacturing processes in a dry or powder form rather than in liquid or paste form. Presis has working prototypes that it is utilizing for research and testing which will require further engineering before being placed in commercial operation. In the event the process is successfully developed, Presis expects to market its process to companies processing pigments used in the production of inks, paints and coatings by replacing or supplementing current wet milling processes.* The Company does not expect to spend a material amount on research and development in 2001.* The Company does not believe that its business will be materially affected by environmental laws.*

The Energy Policy Act of 1992 established a coordinated Federal EMF research program which ended in 1998. In 1999, the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS), as required by the Act, provided a report to Congress summarizing the results of this program. The report concluded that "the probability that ...EMF is truly a health hazard is currently small" and that the evidence that exists for health effects is "insufficient to warrant aggressive regulatory actions." Nevertheless, the NIEHS identified several areas where further research might be warranted. AEP has supported EMF research through the years and continues to fund the Electric Power Research Institute's EMF research program, contributing over $400,000 to this program in 2001, and intending to contribute a similar amount in 2002. See Research and Development.

The Energy Policy Act of 1992 established a coordinated Federal EMF research program which ended in 1998. In 1999, the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS), as required by the Act, provided a report to Congress summarizing the results of this program. The report concluded that "the probability that ...EMF is truly a health hazard is currently small" and that the evidence that exists for health effects is "insufficient to warrant aggressive regulatory actions." Nevertheless, the NIEHS identified several areas where further research might be warranted. AEP has supported EMF research through the years and continues to fund the Electric Power Research Institute's EMF research program, contributing over $400,000 to this program in 2000 and intending to contribute a similar amount in 2001. See Research and Development.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
research and development
AEP System operating companies are members of the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI), an organization founded in 1973 that manages research and development initiatives on behalf of its members. EPRI's members include investor owned and public utilities, independent power producers, international organizations and others.
research and development
AEP participates in EPRI programs that meet its research and development objectives. Total AEP dues to EPRI were $17,000,000 for 2000, $22,000,000 for 1999 and $23,000,000 for 1998. Of these amounts, the former CSW System paid approximately $7,000,000 in 2000, $8,000,00 in 1999 and $8,000,000 in 1998 for EPRI programs.
research and development
Total research and development expenditures by AEP and its subsidiaries, including EPRI dues, were approximately $20,000,000 for the year ended December 31, 2000, $25,000,000 for the year ended December 31, 1999 and $32,000,000 for the year ended December 31, 1998.
