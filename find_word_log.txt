Our Cargo Systems unit was selected in June 2005 to provide cargo loading systems for the Airbus A400M Military Transport Aircraft ("A400M"). We have incurred significant engineering and development costs in connection with this program (see Note 12 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements), and we expect to incur additional development costs as the design is certified. The certification of our design for full functionality is currently scheduled for the third quarter of calendar 2014. In July 2013, we and Airbus amended the A400M contract to make changes to the Company's role and responsibilities under the program, establish a fixed price per shipset, set applicable weight parameters and make certain other changes.
development cost
We may not be able to recover our engineering and development costs, which could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition, under certain circumstances, including the following: (i) we are not able to obtain certification of the design of the system in the third quarter of calendar 2014; (ii) the A400M program experiences significant additional delivery delays or order cancellations; (iii) we fail to achieve the expected production cost reductions; (iv) we fail to deliver the items that we are now responsible for in accordance with the terms of the amended contract; or (v) the contract is further amended to change our role and responsibilities.

Our Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Management has made estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities to prepare the Consolidated Financial Statements. The most significant estimates made by management include those related to the allowance for doubtful accounts, assumptions used in assessing goodwill impairment, adjustments to reduce the value of inventories and aviation equipment on or available for lease, revenue recognition, loss accruals for aviation equipment operating leases, program development costs and assumptions used in determining pension plan obligations. Accordingly, actual results could differ materially from those estimates. The following is a summary of the accounting policies considered critical by management.

As of May 31, 2014 and 2013, we have capitalized, net of reimbursements, $139.8 million and $130.9 million, respectively, of costs associated with the engineering and development of the cargo system. Sales and related cost of sales are recognized on the units of delivery method. In determining the recoverability of the capitalized program development costs, we have made certain judgments and estimates concerning expected revenues and the cost to manufacture the A400M cargo system. Differences between actual results and our assumptions may result in our not fully recovering program development costs, which could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.

Our Cargo Systems unit was selected in June 2005 to provide cargo loading systems for the Airbus A400M Military Transport Aircraft ("A400M"). We have incurred significant engineering and development costs in connection with this program (see Note 15 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements), and we expect to incur additional costs until final design approval, which is currently scheduled for the first calendar quarter of 2014. In July 2013, we and Airbus amended the A400M contract to make changes to the Company's role and responsibilities under the program, establish a fixed price per shipset, set applicable weight parameters and make certain other changes. The Company believes that the revised fixed pricing schedule will enable the Company to recover its engineering and development costs, provided the Company achieves specified reductions in the production costs of those items over which it has continuing responsibility.

We may not be able to recover our engineering and development costs, which could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition, under certain circumstances, including the following: (i) the A400M program experiences significant additional delivery delays or order cancellations; (ii) we fail to achieve the expected production cost reductions; (iii) we fail to deliver the items that we are now responsible for in accordance with the terms of the amended contract; or (iv) the contract is further amended to change our role and responsibilities.

Operating income decreased $31,626 or 23.5% compared with the prior year due to the impairment charges and an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $11,717 primarily as a result of the impact of acquisitions. Net interest expense increased $2,281 or 8.2% versus the prior year principally due to a full year of expense related to the convertible notes issued in February 2008 offset by a reduction in outstanding borrowings and lower interest rates on our revolving credit agreement. Our effective income tax rate decreased to 31.9% compared to 34.7% in the prior year.
