Our Cargo Systems unit was selected in June 2005 to provide cargo loading systems for the Airbus A400M Military Transport Aircraft ("A400M"). We have incurred significant engineering and development costs in connection with this program (see Note 12 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements), and we expect to incur additional development costs as the design is certified. The certification of our design for full functionality is currently scheduled for the third quarter of calendar 2014. In July 2013, we and Airbus amended the A400M contract to make changes to the Company's role and responsibilities under the program, establish a fixed price per shipset, set applicable weight parameters and make certain other changes.

We may not be able to recover our engineering and development costs, which could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition, under certain circumstances, including the following: (i) we are not able to obtain certification of the design of the system in the third quarter of calendar 2014; (ii) the A400M program experiences significant additional delivery delays or order cancellations; (iii) we fail to achieve the expected production cost reductions; (iv) we fail to deliver the items that we are now responsible for in accordance with the terms of the amended contract; or (v) the contract is further amended to change our role and responsibilities.

Our Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Management has made estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities to prepare the Consolidated Financial Statements. The most significant estimates made by management include those related to the allowance for doubtful accounts, assumptions used in assessing goodwill impairment, adjustments to reduce the value of inventories and aviation equipment on or available for lease, revenue recognition, loss accruals for aviation equipment operating leases, program development costs and assumptions used in determining pension plan obligations. Accordingly, actual results could differ materially from those estimates. The following is a summary of the accounting policies considered critical by management.

As of May 31, 2014 and 2013, we have capitalized, net of reimbursements, $139.8 million and $130.9 million, respectively, of costs associated with the engineering and development of the cargo system. Sales and related cost of sales are recognized on the units of delivery method. In determining the recoverability of the capitalized program development costs, we have made certain judgments and estimates concerning expected revenues and the cost to manufacture the A400M cargo system. Differences between actual results and our assumptions may result in our not fully recovering program development costs, which could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.

Our Cargo Systems unit was selected in June 2005 to provide cargo loading systems for the Airbus A400M Military Transport Aircraft ("A400M"). We have incurred significant engineering and development costs in connection with this program (see Note 15 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements), and we expect to incur additional costs until final design approval, which is currently scheduled for the first calendar quarter of 2014. In July 2013, we and Airbus amended the A400M contract to make changes to the Company's role and responsibilities under the program, establish a fixed price per shipset, set applicable weight parameters and make certain other changes. The Company believes that the revised fixed pricing schedule will enable the Company to recover its engineering and development costs, provided the Company achieves specified reductions in the production costs of those items over which it has continuing responsibility.

Given the constant evolution of technology in our industry, we believe it is important to develop new products so we can continue to meet our customers needs. We continually review and evaluate technological changes affecting our industry and invest in applications-based research and development. The focus of our research and development activities will change over time based on customer needs and industry trends as well as our decisions regarding those areas where we believe we are most likely to achieve success and advance our strategic aims. Our current projects have varying risk and reward profiles. As part of our longer-term strategy, we intend to continue an ongoing program of new product development that combines internal development efforts with acquisitions and strategic alliances within spaces that are closely related to our core businesses.

In the current capital spending environment of our customers, we believe we must find ways to grow our sales  particularly in product sets that service the ongoing network evolution. To grow sales in these areas, we will seek to expand our market share and develop new sales channels. We also will look actively to expand our product breadth in existing and related markets through both strategic acquisitions and our own research and development efforts.

To grow our business further we believe we must continue to search for appropriate acquisition candidates and invest in research and development initiatives. We seek acquisitions primarily to strengthen our core product portfolio and enhance our growth initiatives in fiber, wireless and enterprise markets. In addition, we are focused on finding acquisitions that may expand the reach of our geographic sales and enhance our global operations. Because several of our largest customers are consolidating to gain greater scale and broaden their service offerings, we also believe it is appropriate for companies in our industry to consolidate in order to gain greater scale and position themselves to offer a wider array of products. We expect to fund potential acquisitions with existing cash resources, the issuance of shares of common or preferred stock, the issuance of debt or equity linked securities or through some combination of these alternatives. Our internal research and development efforts are focused on those areas where we believe we are most likely to achieve success and on projects that we believe directly advance our strategic aims. This includes a portfolio of projects with varying risk and reward profiles. We also will continue to evaluate and monitor our existing business and product lines for growth and profitability potential.

In the current environment of constrained capital spending increases by communications service providers, we believe that we must find ways to grow our sales. Our strategy is to focus more attention for growth in certain product and market segments. These product segments include next-generation core networks, FTTX, wireless capacity/coverage, network automation and enterprise network upgrades. In addition, we intend to focus more attention on emerging markets such as China and India where we believe the potential for growth is higher than in more established markets. To grow sales, we will seek to expand our market share, develop new sales channels and expand our product breadth in existing and related markets through our own research and development efforts and strategic acquisitions.

Our acquisition in fiscal 2005 of Fiber Optic Network Solutions Corp. (FONS), which has enhanced our FTTX offerings, is an example of this strategy. In addition, we are focused on finding acquisitions that may enhance our geographic operations.

In the current environment of constrained capital spending increases by communications service providers, we believe that we must find ways to grow our sales. Our strategy is to focus more attention for growth in certain product and market segments. These product segments include next-generation core networks, FTTX, wireless capacity/coverage, network automation and enterprise network upgrades. In addition, we intend to focus more attention on emerging markets such as China and India where we believe the potential for growth is higher than in more established markets. To grow sales, we will seek to expand our market share, develop new sales channels and expand our product breadth in existing and related markets through our own research and development efforts and strategic acquisitions.
research and development
Finally, to further grow our business, we continue to invest in research and development initiatives and to search for appropriate acquisition opportunities. Our internal research and development efforts are focused on those areas where we believe we are most likely to achieve success and on projects that we believe directly advance our strategic aims with a higher probability to return our investment. We seek acquisitions primarily to strengthen our core product portfolio. Our efforts are focused on opportunities within our existing markets, as well as in adjacent or related markets that will strengthen our product offerings. Our acquisition in fiscal 2005 of Fiber Optic Network Solutions Corp. (FONS), which has enhanced our FTTX offerings, is an example of this strategy. In addition, we are focused on finding acquisitions that may enhance our geographic operations. Because several of our largest customers are consolidating to gain greater scale and broaden their service offerings, we also believe it is appropriate for companies in our industry to consolidate in order to gain greater scale and position themselves to offer a wider array of products. Our attempt to merge with Andrew Corporation during fiscal 2006, which was terminated primarily over concerns regarding the ability to obtain necessary shareholder approval, was predicated on this belief. We expect to fund potential acquisitions with

We believe that our future success depends, in part, on our ability to adapt to the rapidly changing communications environment so we can maintain our significant expertise in core technologies and continue to anticipate and meet our customers needs. We continually review and evaluate technological changes affecting the communications market and invest in applications-based research and development. The focus of our research and development activities will change over time based on particular customer needs and industry trends as well as our decisions regarding those areas in which we believe we are most likely to achieve success. As part of our long-term strategy, we intend to continue an ongoing program of new product development that combines internal development efforts with acquisitions and strategic alliances relating to new products and technologies from sources outside ADC. Our expenses for internal research and development activities were $72.4 million, $71.6 million and $59.1 million, in fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. These amounts represented 5.6%, 6.3% and 8.1%, of our total revenues in each of those respective fiscal years. These percentages have decreased over time as we have become more focused on certain initiatives and as our operations became more concentrated in infrastructure products.

During fiscal 2006, our research and development activities were directed primarily at the following areas:
research and development
New product development often requires long-term forecasting of market trends, the development and implementation of new processes and technologies and substantial capital commitment. Due to the uncertainties inherent in each of these elements, there can be no assurance that any new products we develop will achieve market acceptance or be profitable. In addition, as we balance product development with our efforts to achieve sustained profitability, we are more selective in our research and development in order to focus on projects that we believe directly advance our strategic aims and have a higher probability to return our investment.

In addition, we do not know whether our products and services will meet with market acceptance or be profitable. Many of our competitors have greater engineering and product development resources than us. Although we expect to continue to invest substantial resources in product development activities, our efforts to achieve and maintain profitability will require us to be more selective and focused with our research and development expenditures. If we fail to anticipate or respond in a cost-effective and timely manner to technological developments, changes in industry standards or customer requirements, or if we have any significant delays in product development or introduction, our business, operating results and financial condition could be affected adversely.

In December 2001, we purchased Competences 66% interest in one of the joint ventures for $3.9 million in cash and assumption of approximately $16.5 million in debt owed by that joint venture, the proceeds of which were being used to fund the development of technology. In February 2002, we purchased Competences remaining interests in the other joint ventures for approximately $350,000 in cash and assumption of approximately $4.2 million in debt, the proceeds of which were used to fund the development of the technology. The debt was paid off immediately following the purchases. We recorded expense for in-process research and development projects associated with the purchase of Competences interest in these ventures in fiscal 2002 of $10.5 million. In addition, $10.3 million was allocated to developed technology, of which $5.3 million was written off prior to fiscal 2003. The remainder is being amortized over a period of seven years.

Research and development expenses were $176.4 million for fiscal 2002, representing a 36.7% decrease from $278.6 million for fiscal 2001. We believe that given the rapidly changing technology and competitive environment in the communications equipment industry, continued commitment to product development efforts will be required for us to remain competitive. Accordingly, we intend to continue to allocate substantial resources, as a percentage of our net sales, to product development for each of our operating segments.

In January 2001 and December 2001, we entered into a total of three joint ventures with Competence Research and Development Ltd., an independent company. The joint ventures were established to share development risk and capital resources associated with the ongoing development of technology used in our iAN, BroadAccess and Small Subscriber product lines. The joint ventures were successful in advancing the development of technology related to these product lines. When the joint ventures were established we held 34%, 20% and 49% interests, respectively, in the three joint venture entities. Because we did not have majority control over the joint ventures, these investments were accounted for using the equity method. Therefore, a pro rata portion of the joint ventures' profits or losses is reflected in our consolidated income statement as Other Income (Expense). In fiscal 2002 and 2001, we incurred approximately $2.6 million and $9.7 million, respectively, in equity losses related to these joint ventures.

In December 2001, we purchased Competence's 66% interest in one of the joint ventures for $3.9 million in cash and assumption of approximately $16.5 million in debt owed by that joint venture, the proceeds of which were being used to fund the development of technology. In February 2002, we purchased Competence's remaining interests in the other joint ventures for approximately $350,000 in cash and assumption of approximately $4.2 million in debt, the proceeds of which were used to fund the development of the technology. The debt was paid off immediately following the purchases. We recorded expense for in-process research and development projects associated with the purchase of Competence's interest in these ventures in fiscal 2002 of $10.5 million. In addition, $10.3 million was allocated to developed technology, which will be amortized over a period of seven years. Appraisals for

The Company conducts research and development activities internally in its Elmsford, New York facility as well as in its Verona, Italy facility, and contracts out certain projects to qualified vendors and external consultants, as needed. The Company’s research and development efforts and technologies were significantly enhanced by the acquisition of QR on April 19, 2007. The Company’s main focus is to continue to develop products that offer diagnostic treatment options that offer user comfort and are competitively priced. The Company has integrated its research and development between both locations.
research and development
The Company is subject to both foreign and domestic competition. Competitors have made significant investments in research and development of new technologies, products and services. Some competitors are well established in similar manufacturing and distribution businesses and may have greater financial, manufacturing and distribution resources than the Company. With respect to all of its products, the Company competes on the basis of function, features, product specifications, price per application, promptness of delivery and customer service. The Company purchases certain products from others for resale on a non-exclusive basis, which may be subject to competition from the suppliers or other independent distributors.
development cost
There was no write-off of In Process Research and Development Costs in Fiscal Year 2008. The write-off in Fiscal Year 2007 of $3,760,000 was related to in-process research and development that had been acquired as part of the purchase of QR. The capitalization and immediate write-off were recorded as a result of the allocation of the purchase price of QR. These charges will not have a continued impact on the Company’s future operating results.
development cost
Research and development costs increased approximately $946,700, or 92.7%, between Fiscal Year 2007 and Fiscal Year 2008. The Company’s research and development efforts and technologies were significantly enhanced by the acquisition of QR. All of this increase was due to research and development efforts in Italy, where the primary focus is on three-dimensional imaging systems. These expenses are denominated in Euros and therefore are subject to variations in the US dollar/Euro exchange rate fluctuations. The Company continues to invest in the design, development and refinement of its existing digital imaging equipment, as well as the design and development of new digital imaging equipment for the human dental and broad veterinary applications. Research and development costs may fluctuate between reporting periods, due to changing research and development consulting agreements, initiation or completion of certain project tasks, and market demands. Research and development costs may continue to increase over the next several years as the Company evaluates its strategy to develop and market additional high tech digital products. The Company has integrated its research and development between both locations.
research and development
The Company wrote-off approximately $3,760,000 of costs related to in process research and development that had been acquired as part of the purchase of QR. As of June 30, 2007, no alternative future use was identified for these assets and, accordingly, these assets were written off in Fiscal Year 2007. The capitalization and immediate write-off were recorded as a result of the allocation of the purchase price of QR. These charges will not have a continued impact on the Company’s future operating results.

Research and Development
development cost
The Company conducts research and development activities internally, at the New York facility, as well as contracts certain projects to qualified vendors and expert consultants. The Company's research and development efforts and technologies have been enhanced by business acquisitions completed in Fiscal Years 1997 and 1998. In each of these transactions, the Company added new product lines, and gained proprietary technologies and access to future research and development benefits. Commencing in April 1997, the Company participated in the development of new video/x-ray imaging sensors, including but not limited to Close Coupled Device ("CCD") and Complimentary Metal Oxide Semiconductor ("CMOS") type sensors. Research and development costs for the Fiscal Year 2000 does not include the European Union ("EU") grants paid to the Company for the Company's participation in a CMOS research and development project. All dental applications resulting from the research under the project will be licensed exclusively to the Company. The EU contract expired in May 2000. However, the Company is continuing its research and development efforts previously conducted under the EU contract, with internally generated funds.

The Company's level of research and development spending is discussed further in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation.
research and development
The Company's products utilize mechanical, as well as analog and digital electronic, technologies. The Company is subject to both foreign and domestic competition. The competition is characterized by significant investment in research and development of new technologies, products and services. Some competitors are well established in the film processor manufacturing and distribution businesses and may have greater financial, distribution resources and facilities than the Company. The Company relies on internal research and development personnel as well as subcontracted vendors. With respect to all of its products, the Company competes on the basis of price, features, product quality, applications, engineering, and promptness of delivery and customer service. The Company also manufacturers and provides to OEM customers different product versions which may compete with Company supplied products to other OEM, as well as Company branded products. The Company purchases certain products from others for resale on a non-exclusive basis, which may be subject to competition from other independent distributors.

The acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method. Accordingly, a portion of the purchase price was allocated to the net assets acquired based on their estimated fair values. The Company also allocated a portion of the purchase price to in-process research and development expenditures, which reduced fiscal 1998 operating income by $1.7 million. Such allocation was recorded based on a third party appraisal of the value of the in-process research and development projects acquired as of the acquisition date. The balance of the purchase price was recorded as the excess of cost over net assets acquired ("goodwill"). As discussed in Note 9, no goodwill resulting from this acquisition remains as of June 30, 1999 due to the purchase price adjustment discussed above and the write-off of $1.3 million of goodwill which became impaired during 1999.

The Company's Pharmaceuticals business is actively working on the development of new pain products which, if successful, would include a technology designed to deter abuse. During the fourth quarter of 2007, Pharmaceuticals reported positive results from its Phase III double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled pivotal efficacy trial for EMBEDA, its investigational abuse deterrent extended-release morphine product. The trial of over 500 patients demonstrated that EMBEDA delivered statistically significant pain relief versus placebo. Pharmaceuticals is targeting the filing of a New Drug Application (NDA) in the first quarter of 2008 for EMBEDA. The Company expects significant research and development investment in 2008 in support of its abuse-deterrent opioid product development programs as well as investment in support for the launch and optimized commercialization of FLECTOR Patch. See "Research, Product Development and Technical Activities" and "Risk Factor - The Company's products and future products are based on technologies in areas where third parties hold numerous patents".

Another of API's main expansion initiatives is forward integration into the injectable finished product form of several of its APIs. The Company is in the process of expanding its Copenhagen facility to meet capacity requirements for this new initiative. Potential sources for additional new products are API's internal research and development, co-development projects with third parties, partnerships and in-licensing. See "Risk Factors - The Company depends on development, manufacture and marketing of new products for its future success" and "The Company could have difficulties in developing and integrating strategic alliances, co-development opportunities and other relationships".

AH's main expansion initiatives focus on new products from research and development activities, the purchase of businesses or individual products from third parties, co-development and in-licensing and expanding the geographic reach of its current product line with new registrations in new jurisdictions. See "Risk Factors - The Company depends on development, manufacture and marketing of new products for its future success" and "Risk Factors - The Company could have difficulties in developing and integrating strategic alliances, co-development opportunities and other relationships".
research and development
Research and development is important to each of the Company's continuing business segments. The Company's research, product development and technical activities in the Pharmaceuticals business are directed toward developing proprietary drug delivery systems, line extensions and new pain products with abuse deterrent technology. In addition, IDEA AG is developing the Company's licensed product ketoprofen in TRANSFERSOME gel. The Company's API business performs research and development activities on chemical synthesis, fermentation and purification technologies intended to permit the introduction of additional products. Additionally, it is in the process of developing the injectable finished product form for several of its APIs. The Company is focusing its AH product development spending on activities complementary to in-licensing and co-developing technologies through arrangements with third parties.
research and development
Most technical product development for Pharmaceuticals is conducted in its Piscataway, New Jersey site, though some technical product development in 2008 will continue to be conducted in Elizabeth, New Jersey in laboratories leased from Actavis. The Oslo, Norway and Copenhagen, Denmark facilities are used for API research and development. The Company conducts its technical product development activities for AH at its facilities in Willow Island, West Virginia, Chicago Heights, Illinois, Bridgewater, New Jersey, and contract research organizations. Independent research facilities in the U.S. and Europe are used for all business segments.
research and development
The Company, in its continuing businesses, expended approximately $140.3 million, including the $60.0 million upfront payment to IDEA, $44.4 million and $26.9 million on research and development efforts in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The Company expects its total research and development spending in 2008, including potential product licensing milestone payments (including $77 million in potential payments for ketoprofen in TRANSFERSOME gel) to be 10 to 20% higher than in 2007. Most of this spending will be for the development of Pharmaceuticals' investigational abuse-deterrent pain product platform and certain development initiatives in connection with commercializing the FLECTOR Patch. Research and development activities are inherently speculative. Investments in research and development do not always result in the successful development of a product. Accordingly, it should not be assumed that potential products in the Company's pipeline will be successfully commercialized.

Pharmaceuticals is focused primarily on the pain management market in the United States. It markets two branded pharmaceutical prescription products, a pain medication sold in the U.S. under the trademark KADIAN and a prescription topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory ("NSAID") patch product marketed in the U.S., beginning in January 2008, under the trademark FLECTOR. Both drugs are manufactured by third parties. For the year ended December 31, 2007, Pharmaceuticals had product sales, consisting solely of KADIAN, of approximately $167.7 million and an operating loss of approximately $61.5 million. Included in this loss was a research and development charge of $60 million related to the initial upfront payment to IDEA AG for the exclusive U.S. rights to ketoprofen in TRANSFERSOME gel, an NSAID in clinical development. KADIAN accounted for approximately 23% of the Company's total revenues in 2007.
research and development
Pharmaceuticals realizes significant gross profit margins on its sales of KADIAN, but competes in a highly competitive market, and is subject to potential challenges from generic equivalents. The Company's business plan includes significant investments in research and development spending to broaden its product pipeline. This includes investments associated with the development of next-generation opioid pain products which include technology designed to deter abuse and potential milestone payments to IDEA AG for ketoprofen in TRANSFERSOME gel, a prescription topical NSAID in clinical development. In connection with its January 2008 launch of the FLECTOR Patch, Pharmaceuticals has made significant investments in sales and marketing in support of an expanded sales force and promotional activities.

● In March 2007, the Company entered into an exclusive development and licensing agreement with Tris Pharma, Inc. ("Tris"), a privately owned specialty pharmaceutical company engaged in the research and development of drug delivery technologies.
r&d
Research and development expenses increased $95.8 million compared to 2006, due primarily to the $60.0 million upfront payment to IDEA, and spending related to clinical trials related to abuse-deterrent opioid product development programs in Pharmaceuticals. As a percentage of revenues, R&D expenses amounted to 19.4% (or 11.1%, excluding the $60.0 million upfront payment to IDEA) in 2007 compared to 6.8% in 2006.

development cost
The Company's products are subject to regulation by governmental authorities, principally the Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") in the United States and equivalent authorities in international markets. Research and development expenses are charged to the consolidated statement of operations when incurred, as the Company considers that regulatory and other uncertainties inherent in the development of new products preclude it from capitalizing development costs.
r&d
Acquired products or projects which have not achieved technical feasibility (i.e., regulatory approval) are charged to the statement of operations on the date of acquisition. In connection with its acquisitions, the Company generally utilizes independent appraisers in the determination of IPR&D charges. The amount of this charge is determined based on a variety of factors including the estimated future cash flows of the product or project, the likelihood of future benefit from the product or project, and the level of risk associated with future research and development activities related to the product or project.

Research and Development:
research and development
Expenditures for research and development are expensed as incurred. Property and equipment that are acquired or constructed for research and development activities and that have alternate future uses are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis. Upfront and milestone payments made to third parties in connection with agreements with third parties are generally expensed as incurred up to the point of regulatory approval, absent any alternative future uses. Payments made to third parties subsequent to regulatory approval are generally capitalized and amortized over the remaining useful life of the related product. Amounts capitalized for such payments are included in intangibles, net of accumulated amortization.

Software and Development Costs:
development cost
In 2007, 2006, and 2005, the Company capitalized purchased software from third-party vendors and software development costs incurred under the provisions of SOP 98-1, "Accounting for the Cost of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use". Capitalized costs include only (1) external direct costs of materials and services incurred in developing or obtaining internal use software, (2) payroll and payroll-related costs for employees who are directly associated with and who devote substantial time to the internal-use software project, and (3) interest costs incurred, while developing internal-use software. Amortization begins as portions of the projects are completed, ready for their intended purpose and placed in service.
development cost
Research and development costs, business process re-engineering costs, training and computer software maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. Software development costs are being amortized using the straight-line method over the expected life of the projects which are estimated to be five to seven years.

The Company's Pharmaceuticals business is actively working on the development of a new pain product which, if successful, would include a technology designed to deter abuse. During the third quarter of 2006, Pharmaceuticals reported positive results from a Phase II efficacy and pharmacokinetic trial for the investigational abuse deterrent extended-release morphine product. The goal of the study was to demonstrate that the Company's proprietary abuse-deterrent technology for long-acting opioids does not impact the safety or efficacy of the product. This goal was achieved. Pharmaceuticals has commenced Phase III activities on this new product and, assuming a successful Phase III outcome, is targeting a New Drug Application (NDA) filing in the first half of 2008. The Company expects significant research and development investment in 2007 and 2008 in support of its abuse-deterrent opioid product development programs. See "Research, Product Development and Technical Activities" and "Risk Factors - The Company's products and future products are based on technologies in areas where third parties hold numerous patents".
research and development
The Company has several growth initiatives related to API. API has initiated a program of new product launches that began in 2005 with the launch (commercial sale of product) of tobramycin and continued with the launch of fluticasone and teicoplanin in non-regulated markets in the third quarter of 2006 and mupirocin acid in the fourth quarter of 2006. The Company intends to continue to invest in and develop its API pipeline and expects to launch two additional products before the end of 2007. In addition, in the second quarter of 2006, API reached agreement with Hisun Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., a Chinese supplier, that, subject to regulatory approvals, is expected to enable the Company to increase the manufacturing capacity of one of its current major products, vancomycin, over the next three years. During the third quarter of 2006, the Company commenced the sale of vancomycin manufactured at the Hisun facility into limited markets, and began enhancing the site's manufacturing processes in preparation for regulatory approvals. Another of API's main expansion initiatives is forward integration into the injectable finished product form of several of its APIs. The Company is in the process of expanding its Copenhagen facility to meet capacity requirements for this new initiative. Potential sources for additional new products are API's internal research and development, co-development projects with third parities, partnerships and in-licensing. See "Risk Factors -. The Company depends on development, manufacture and marketing of new products for its future success" and "The Company could have difficulties in developing and integrating strategic alliances, co-development opportunities and other relationships".

Research and development is important to each of the Company's continuing business segments. The Company's research, product development and technical activities in the Pharmaceuticals business are directed toward developing proprietary drug delivery systems, line extensions and new pain products with abuse deterrent technology. The Company's API business performs research and development activities on chemical synthesis, fermentation and purification technologies intended to permit the introduction of additional products. The Company is focusing its AH product development spending on activities complementary to in-licensing and co-developing technologies through arrangements with third parties.
research and development
Most technical product development for Pharmaceuticals is conducted in its Piscataway, New Jersey site, though some technical product development in 2007 will continue to be conducted in Elizabeth, New Jersey in laboratories leased from Actavis. The Company conducts its technical product development activities for AH at its facilities in Willow Island, West Virginia; Chicago Heights, Illinois; Fort Lee, New Jersey; and contract research organizations. The Oslo, Norway and Copenhagen, Denmark facilities are used for API research and development. Independent research facilities in the U.S. and Europe are used for all business segments.
research and development
Research and development expenses, excluding Discontinued Operations, were $44.4 million, $26.9 million and $25.4 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. In 2007, the Company intends to increase its spending on research and development by approximately $30 to $35 million. Most of this increased spending will be for the development of Pharmaceuticals' investigational abuse-deterrent pain product platform. Research and development activities are inherently speculative. Investments in research and development do not always result in the successful development of a product. Accordingly, it should not be assumed that potential products in the Company's pipeline will be successfully commercialized.

Product Lines. The Company's API business markets and sells primarily 10 antibiotic APIs. APIs constitute the active substances in certain pharmaceuticals for the treatment of some skin, throat, intestinal and systemic infections. The Company is a leading producer of bacitracin, polymyxin, and vancomycin; all of which are important pharmaceutical grade antibiotics. The Company's API business also manufactures other antibiotic active substances such as tobramycin, colistin and methsulfate and colistin and amphotericin B, a parenteral grade antifungal. The primary applications for the API products are injectable and specialized topical and human surgical finished product applications. API owns European marketing authorizations for vancomycin vial and capsule finished products which are manufactured (using the Company's active substance) and distributed for the Company by third parties. The Company has initiated a program of new product launches in its API business. The program began in 2005 with the launch of Tobramycin and will continue with a planned launch of Fluticasone in non-regulated markets in the second quarter of 2006. The Company will continue to invest in and develop its API pipeline and expects to launch one or two additional products before the end of the year. Potential sources for additional new products are the API's research and development, co-development projects with third parities, partnerships and in-licensing. See Risk Factors - "The Company depends on development, manufacture and marketing of new products for its future success" and "The Company could have difficulties in developing and integrating strategic alliances, co-development opportunities and other relationships".

Success in the generic industry depends on developing, manufacturing and marketing new products, including generic versions of products no longer subject to patent protection. The successful introduction of new products is affected by the timing of introduction. Being first to market can bring significant returns. Introducing a new product after or with a number of competitors generates significantly lower returns. During 2004, the Company launched three new products in the U.S. The number of competitors caused pricing and market share to be significantly lower than expected. The Company increased research and development spending in 2004 to increase filings with regulatory agencies and increase the number of new product introductions.

The Human Pharmaceuticals business manufactures and markets its primary products, generic pharmaceuticals, through its IG and U.S. Human Pharmaceuticals businesses. The Human Pharmaceuticals business also markets specialty brand name pharmaceuticals in the U.S. through its Branded Pharmaceuticals unit. In addition, through API, the Human Pharmaceuticals business manufactures and markets a line of fermentation based active pharmaceutical ingredients that are used, primarily by third parties, in the manufacture of generic and branded finished pharmaceutical products. Through acquisitions, the Company has expanded its range of products and enhanced its research and development capabilities.

Facilities. USHP maintains and operates three manufacturing facilities, two research and development centers, four telemarketing facilities and one automated central distribution center. USHP's largest manufacturing facility is located in Baltimore, Maryland and is dedicated solely to the manufacture of liquid pharmaceuticals. (See "Government Regulation - Facility Compliance".) The Company's facility in Lincolnton, North Carolina manufactures creams, ointments and suppositories. As a result of the Faulding Acquisition, the Company acquired Purepac's oral solid dose facility in Elizabeth, New Jersey, which manufactures tablets and capsules, and a new facility in Piscataway, New Jersey.
research and development
(until June 2003) and a third party facility. In June of 2003, the blending of Deccox was moved to the Company's Chicago Heights facility. Product research and development is done at AH's Chicago Heights, Willow Island and Oslo facilities. The Company manufactures its fish vaccine products at its Overhalla, Norway facility and third party facilities and utilizes contract manufacturing to provide certain raw materials for vaccine production. The Company has closed its facilities at Hannibal, Missouri, Lowell, Arkansas, Parkville, Australia, and its research and development facility in Wrightstown, New Jersey. Products currently produced at these facilities will be supplied by other Company facilities or third parties where required. The Wrightstown facility was sold during 2003.
research and development
Scientific development is important to each of the Company's business segments. The Company's research, product development and technical activities in the human generic pharmaceuticals business, which is mainly performed within the U.S., concentrate on the development of generic equivalents of established patented products, as well as discovering novel treatment uses of existing drugs. Such research, product development and technical activities also focus on developing proprietary drug delivery systems, patent circumvention in the U.S. and on improving existing delivery systems, packaging and manufacturing techniques. The Company's API business performs research and development activities on chemical synthesis, fermentation and purification technologies in Norway and Denmark.
research and development
The Company's research and development capabilities have been enhanced and broadened as a result of the Faulding Acquisition, strengthening its ability to introduce new products and its expertise in the area of extended release products and the formulation and manufacture of oral solid dose products. In view of the substantial funds that are generally required to develop new chemical drug entities, the Company does not anticipate undertaking significant activities in this area.
research and development
The Company's technical development activities for animal pharmaceuticals previously involved extensive product development and testing for the primary purpose of establishing clinical support for new products and additional uses for variations of existing products and seeking related FDA and other governmental approvals. The Company focused its AH product development spending in 2003 on activities such as in-licensing and co-developing technologies through arrangements with third parties as well as on its own research and development of vaccines for farmed fish, and will continue this focus in 2004.
research and development
Given the Company's global presence and its focus on research and development, the Company seeks to:
research and development
shorten product development cycles for introduction and approval of similar products across geographic markets through the exchange of knowledge across its global research and development efforts; and
research and development
capitalize on the globalized human pharmaceutical research and development function in order to be more efficient in the scope of research activities, including the distribution of research and development, manufacturing and purchasing costs across a global platform.
research and development
Generally, research and development activities are conducted on a business segment basis.
research and development
The Company conducts its technical product development activities for Animal Health at its facilities in Oslo, Norway; Willow Island, West Virginia; and Chicago Heights, Illinois. The technical product development for finished Human Pharmaceuticals products is conducted in Elizabeth, New Jersey, and Baltimore, Maryland. The Oslo, Norway and Copenhagen, Denmark facilities are used for API research and development. Independent research facilities in the U.S. and Europe are used for each of the business segments. The Company closed its finished product research and development operations in Copenhagen, Denmark in 2001. The Company

Research and development expenses, the majority of which was expended for Human Pharmaceuticals (which exclude legal fees), were approximately $63.2 million, $67.1 million and $86.7 million in 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively. The 2001 expenses include a charge for purchased in-process research and development of $37.7 million related to the Faulding Acquisition.
research and development
Research and development activities are inherently speculative. Investments in research and development do not always result in the successful development of a product. For example, the Company sometimes withdraws or abandons its pending ANDAs, particularly if the product is approved after generic market formation. Accordingly, it should not be assumed that potential products in the Company's pipeline will be successfully commercialized.
research and development
Research and development expenditures will negatively impact the Company's earnings in the short term, and there is no guarantee of success.
research and development
The Company expects to significantly increase its expenditures on research and development efforts. As a result, these research and development expenditures may have an adverse impact on the Company's earnings in the short term. Further, the Company cannot be sure that its research and development expenditures will, in the long term, result in the commercialization of products which prove to be economically successful.

Success in the generic industry depends on developing, manufacturing and marketing new products, including generic versions of products no longer subject to patent protection. The successful introduction of new products is affected by the timing of introduction. Being first to market brings significant returns. Introducing a new product after or with a number of competitors generates significantly lower returns. The Company plans to increase research and development spending in 2004 to increase filings with regulatory agencies and increase the number of new product introductions.
research and development
In July, the Company agreed to acquire the OPB for $660.0 million (approximately $700.0 million including direct acquisition related costs and financing costs). The acquisition closed in December and resulted in significant required charges including a $37.7 million charge for in-process research and development.
r&d
Research and Development Expense ("R&D")
r&d
Research and development expenses decreased $3.9 million in 2003 due to the timing of clinical studies, mainly by USHP and planned reductions by AH. Remediation efforts by USHP personnel has also lowered R&D by shifting resources to corrective actions.
r&d
On a consolidated basis, R&D expense increased $18.1 million. The increase is primarily attributable to the inclusion of OPB operations.
r&d
Purchased in-Process R&D
r&d
In connection with the 2001 purchase of the OPB, the Company expensed $37.7 million of in-process R&D.
r&d
In-Process R&D
r&d
The provision (benefit) for income taxes in 2002 as a percentage of pre-tax income was approximately (40.1%) as compared to (1.5%) in 2001. The major component in 2001 which reduced the effective benefit was reduced as a result of the non-deductible write-off of in-process R&D of $37.7 million recorded in the OPB acquisition. Footnote 15 to the financial statements presents an analysis of the effective tax rate.
r&d
The OPB acquisition closed on December 12, 2001 and in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141 "Business Combinations" was accounted for by the purchase method. Required adjustments for purchase accounting included a step-up of finished goods inventory of $7.1 million of which $1.7 million was expensed as the acquired inventory was sold in December 2001. The remaining balance of $5.4 million was expensed in the first quarter of 2002. The most significant adjustment required by purchase accounting was the valuation and write-off of in-process research and development ("IPR&D"). IPR&D was valued at $37.7 million and was written off without a tax benefit (as required) resulting in a reduction of EPS of $.92. IPR&D was valued based on forecasted after tax cash flows for each potential R&D product adjusted for charges for core technology and use of existing assets. The resultant cash flows were discounted at 15.4% and subsequently reduced for a risk adjustment factor dependent on the probability of achieving the cash flows and, in certain instances, the favorable outcome of litigation.
r&d
Research and Development ("R&D"), Including In-Process R&D ("IPR&D")
development cost
The Company's products are subject to regulation by governmental authorities, principally the Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") in the United States and equivalent authorities in international markets. Research and development expenses are charged to the consolidated statement of operations when incurred, as the Company considers that regulatory and other uncertainties inherent in the development of new products preclude it from capitalizing development costs.
r&d
Acquired products or projects which have not achieved technical feasibility (i.e., regulatory approval) are charged to the statement of operations on the date of acquisition. In connection with its acquisitions, the Company generally utilizes independent appraisers in the determination of IPR&D charges. The amount of this charge is determined based on a variety of factors including the estimated future cash flows of the product or project, the likelihood of future benefit from the product or project, and the level of risk associated with future research and development activities related to the product or project.
r&d
Cash flow from operations in 2003 was $157.0 million compared to $162.2 million and $119.4 million in 2002 and 2001, respectively. 2003 cash flows reflect net income of $13.8 million, non-cash expenses for depreciation, amortization and interest accretion totaling $105.3 million. Cash flow from operations in 2003 was negatively impacted by $22.2 million in debt placement fees paid in connection with the issuance of Senior Notes in the second quarter. Better working capital management and other items make up the balance of the cash provided by operating activities in 2003. 2002 cash flows reflected the generally non-cash nature of charges incurred in 2002. Both the asset write-downs and the debt reduction required substantial non-cash charges. 2001 cash flow reflected the non-cash nature of a number of items which contributed to the net loss for the year. The $37.7 million IPR&D charge, the inventory write-offs of $17.8 million, and the $7.4 million charge on exchange of the convertible debentures for Class A common stock are significant non-cash charges. In 2003, accounts receivable balances increased $12.4 million, net of foreign currency, compared to 2002. This resulted in an increase in days sales outstanding of approximately 68 days in 2003 versus 63 days in 2002, principally due to the geographic mix of business. Since 2002, the Company has emphasized accounts receivable management company-wide. This emphasis has generally yielded positive results, although not all customers follow stated terms and disputes can slow collection. The Company reduced accounts receivable balances in 2002 and 2001 compared to the preceding years by $27.3 million and $26.6 million, respectively. The change in marketing strategy in AH, which reduced the use of sales incentives including terms, in the fourth quarter of 2001 resulted in approximately $17 million of the 2002 decline. The emphasis on accounts receivable management, mentioned above, also contributed to these declines.

Software and Development Costs
development cost
In 2003, 2002 and 2001, the Company capitalized purchased software from a third party vendor and software development costs incurred under the provisions of SOP 98-1, "Accounting for the Cost of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use". Capitalized costs include only (1) external direct costs of materials and services incurred in developing or obtaining internal use software, (2) payroll and payroll-related costs for employees who are directly associated with and who devote substantial time to the internal-use software project, and (3) interest costs incurred, while developing internal-use software. Amortization began in April 2002 as portions of the project were completed, were ready for their intended purpose and were placed in service.
development cost
Research and development costs, business process re-engineering costs, training and computer software maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. Software development costs are being amortized using the straight-line method over the expected life of the product which is estimated to be five to seven years depending on when it is placed in service.
r&d
The transaction generated significant charges for in-process research and development ("IPR&D"), the write-up and subsequent write-off of purchased inventory, financing costs specific to the transaction and integration costs incurred in combining OPB in the United States with the U.S. Pharmaceutical Division ("USPD") to form U.S. Human Pharmaceuticals ("USHP"). IPR&D was valued based on estimated future cash flows for 22 individual products under development, adjusted for charges for core technology and use of existing assets. Cash flows were discounted at a rate of 15.4% and a risk adjustment factor was subsequently applied to each project based on probability of realization of the cash flows. Cash inflows from individual projects are expected to commence during the period ranging from mid-2002 to 2005, depending on the project. The estimated future cash flows are based on assumptions consistent with the OPB's historical performance. The charges can be summarized as follows:

research and development
Generally, research and development activities are conducted on a business segment basis.
research and development
The Company conducts its technical product development activities for Animal Health at its facilities in Oslo, Norway; Willow Island, West Virginia; and Chicago Heights, Illinois. The technical product development for finished Human Pharmaceuticals products is conducted in Elizabeth, New Jersey, and Baltimore, Maryland. The Oslo, Norway and Copenhagen, Denmark facilities are used for API research and development. Independent research facilities in the U.S. and Europe are used for each of the business segments. The Company closed its finished product research and development operations in Copenhagen, Denmark in 2001. The Company

Research and development expenses, the majority of which was expended for Human Pharmaceuticals (which exclude legal fees), were approximately $63.2 million, $67.1 million and $86.7 million in 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively. The 2001 expenses include a charge for purchased in-process research and development of $37.7 million related to the Faulding Acquisition.
research and development
Research and development activities are inherently speculative. Investments in research and development do not always result in the successful development of a product. For example, the Company sometimes withdraws or abandons its pending ANDAs, particularly if the product is approved after generic market formation. Accordingly, it should not be assumed that potential products in the Company's pipeline will be successfully commercialized.
research and development
Research and development expenditures will negatively impact the Company's earnings in the short term, and there is no guarantee of success.
research and development
The Company expects to significantly increase its expenditures on research and development efforts. As a result, these research and development expenditures may have an adverse impact on the Company's earnings in the short term. Further, the Company cannot be sure that its research and development expenditures will, in the long term, result in the commercialization of products which prove to be economically successful.

Success in the generic industry depends on developing, manufacturing and marketing new products, including generic versions of products no longer subject to patent protection. The successful introduction of new products is affected by the timing of introduction. Being first to market brings significant returns. Introducing a new product after or with a number of competitors generates significantly lower returns. The Company plans to increase research and development spending in 2004 to increase filings with regulatory agencies and increase the number of new product introductions.
research and development
In July, the Company agreed to acquire the OPB for $660.0 million (approximately $700.0 million including direct acquisition related costs and financing costs). The acquisition closed in December and resulted in significant required charges including a $37.7 million charge for in-process research and development.
r&d
Research and Development Expense ("R&D")
r&d
Research and development expenses decreased $3.9 million in 2003 due to the timing of clinical studies, mainly by USHP and planned reductions by AH. Remediation efforts by USHP personnel has also lowered R&D by shifting resources to corrective actions.
r&d
On a consolidated basis, R&D expense increased $18.1 million. The increase is primarily attributable to the inclusion of OPB operations.

The provision (benefit) for income taxes in 2002 as a percentage of pre-tax income was approximately (40.1%) as compared to (1.5%) in 2001. The major component in 2001 which reduced the effective benefit was reduced as a result of the non-deductible write-off of in-process R&D of $37.7 million recorded in the OPB acquisition. Footnote 15 to the financial statements presents an analysis of the effective tax rate.
r&d
The OPB acquisition closed on December 12, 2001 and in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141 "Business Combinations" was accounted for by the purchase method. Required adjustments for purchase accounting included a step-up of finished goods inventory of $7.1 million of which $1.7 million was expensed as the acquired inventory was sold in December 2001. The remaining balance of $5.4 million was expensed in the first quarter of 2002. The most significant adjustment required by purchase accounting was the valuation and write-off of in-process research and development ("IPR&D"). IPR&D was valued at $37.7 million and was written off without a tax benefit (as required) resulting in a reduction of EPS of $.92. IPR&D was valued based on forecasted after tax cash flows for each potential R&D product adjusted for charges for core technology and use of existing assets. The resultant cash flows were discounted at 15.4% and subsequently reduced for a risk adjustment factor dependent on the probability of achieving the cash flows and, in certain instances, the favorable outcome of litigation.

Research and Development ("R&D"), Including In-Process R&D ("IPR&D")
development cost
The Company's products are subject to regulation by governmental authorities, principally the Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") in the United States and equivalent authorities in international markets. Research and development expenses are charged to the consolidated statement of operations when incurred, as the Company considers that regulatory and other uncertainties inherent in the development of new products preclude it from capitalizing development costs.
r&d
Acquired products or projects which have not achieved technical feasibility (i.e., regulatory approval) are charged to the statement of operations on the date of acquisition. In connection with its acquisitions, the Company generally utilizes independent appraisers in the determination of IPR&D charges. The amount of this charge is determined based on a variety of factors including the estimated future cash flows of the product or project, the likelihood of future benefit from the product or project, and the level of risk associated with future research and development activities related to the product or project.
r&d
Cash flow from operations in 2003 was $157.0 million compared to $162.2 million and $119.4 million in 2002 and 2001, respectively. 2003 cash flows reflect net income of $16.9 million, non-cash expenses for depreciation, amortization and interest accretion totaling $105.3 million. Cash flow from operations in 2003 was negatively impacted by $22.2 million in debt placement fees paid in connection with the issuance of Senior Notes in the second quarter. Better working capital management and other items make up the balance of the cash provided by operating activities in 2003. 2002 cash flows reflected the generally non-cash nature of charges incurred in 2002. Both the asset write-downs and the debt reduction required substantial non-cash charges. 2001 cash flow reflected the non-cash nature of a number of items which contributed to the net loss for the year. The $37.7 million IPR&D charge, the inventory write-offs of $17.8 million, and the $7.4 million charge on exchange of the convertible debentures for Class A common stock are significant non-cash charges. In 2003, accounts receivable balances increased $12.4 million, net of foreign currency, compared to 2002. This resulted in an increase in days sales outstanding of approximately 68 days in 2003 versus 63 days in 2002, principally due to the geographic mix of business. Since 2002, the Company has emphasized accounts receivable management company-wide. This emphasis has generally yielded positive results, although not all customers follow stated terms and disputes can slow collection. The Company reduced accounts receivable balances in 2002 and 2001 compared to the preceding years by $27.3 million and $26.6 million, respectively. The change in marketing strategy in AH, which reduced the use of sales incentives including terms, in the fourth quarter of 2001 resulted in approximately $17 million of the 2002 decline. The emphasis on accounts receivable management, mentioned above, also contributed to these declines.

Software and Development Costs
development cost
In 2003, 2002 and 2001, the Company capitalized purchased software from a third party vendor and software development costs incurred under the provisions of SOP 98-1, "Accounting for the Cost of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use". Capitalized costs include only (1) external direct costs of materials and services incurred in developing or obtaining internal use software, (2) payroll and payroll-related costs for employees who are directly associated with and who devote substantial time to the internal-use software project, and (3) interest costs incurred, while developing internal-use software. Amortization began in April 2002 as portions of the project were completed, were ready for their intended purpose and were placed in service.
development cost
Research and development costs, business process re-engineering costs, training and computer software maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. Software development costs are being amortized using the straight-line method over the expected life of the product which is estimated to be five to seven years depending on when it is placed in service.
r&d
The transaction generated significant charges for in-process research and development ("IPR&D"), the write-up and subsequent write-off of purchased inventory, financing costs specific to the transaction and integration costs incurred in combining OPB in the United States with the U.S. Pharmaceutical Division ("USPD") to form U.S. Human Pharmaceuticals ("USHP"). IPR&D was valued based on estimated future cash flows for 22 individual products under development, adjusted for charges for core technology and use of existing assets. Cash flows were discounted at a rate of 15.4% and a risk adjustment factor was subsequently applied to each project based on probability of realization of the cash flows. Cash inflows from individual projects are expected to commence during the period ranging from mid-2002 to 2005, depending on the project. The estimated future cash flows are based on assumptions consistent with the OPB's historical performance. The charges can be summarized as follows:

The Human Pharmaceuticals business manufactures and markets its primary products, generic pharmaceuticals, through its International Generics and U.S. Human Pharmaceuticals businesses. The Human Pharmaceuticals business also markets specialty brand name pharmaceuticals through its U.S. Branded Pharmaceuticals business and, in certain international markets, through its Human Pharmaceuticals International business. In addition, the Human Pharmaceuticals business manufactures and markets a line of fermentation based active pharmaceutical ingredients that are used, primarily by third parties, in the manufacture of generic and branded finished pharmaceutical products. Through acquisitions, the Company has expanded its range of products and enhanced its research and development capabilities.

Facilities. USHP maintains and operates three manufacturing facilities, with a fourth facility expected to be operational during 2003, two research and development centers, four telemarketing facilities and two automated central distribution centers. USHP's largest manufacturing facility is located in Baltimore, Maryland and is dedicated solely to the manufacture of liquid and nasal spray pharmaceuticals. (See "Government Regulation - Facility Compliance".) The Company's facility in Lincolnton, North Carolina manufactures creams, ointments and suppositories. As a result of the Faulding acquisition, the Company acquired Purepac's oral solid dose facility in Elizabeth, New Jersey, which manufactures tablets and capsules, and a new facility in Piscataway, New Jersey.

The Company manufactures its fish vaccine products at its Overhalla, Norway facility and third party facilities and utilizes contract manufacturing to provide certain raw materials for vaccine production. The Company has announced that it will be closing its facilities at Hannibal, Missouri, Lowell, Arkansas, Parkville, Australia, and Wrightstown, New Jersey. Products currently produced at these facilities will be supplied by other Company facilities or third parties where required.
research and development
Scientific development is important to each of the Company's business segments. The Company's research, product development and technical activities in the human generic pharmaceuticals business, which is mainly performed within the U.S., concentrate on the development of generic equivalents of established patented products, as well as discovering novel treatment uses of existing drugs. Such research, product development and technical activities also focus on developing proprietary drug delivery systems, patent circumvention in the U.S. and on improving existing delivery systems, packaging and manufacturing techniques. The Company's API business performs research and development activities on chemical synthesis fermentation and purification technologies in Norway and Denmark.
research and development
The Company's research and development capabilities have been enhanced and broadened as a result of the Faulding Acquisition, strengthening its ability to introduce new products and its expertise in the area of extended release products and the formulation and manufacture of oral solid dose products. In view of the substantial funds that are generally required to develop new chemical drug entities, the Company does not anticipate undertaking significant activities in this area.

Both the asset writedowns and the debt reduction required substantial non-cash charges. 2001 cash flow reflected the non-cash nature of a number of items which contributed to the net loss for the year. The $37.7 million IPR&D charge, the inventory write-offs of $17.8 million, and the $7.4 million charge on exchange of the convertible debentures for Class A common stock are significant non-cash charges. Additionally, the Company reduced accounts receivable balances in 2002 and 2001 compared to the preceding year by $27.3 million and $26.6 million, respectively.

In 2002, 2001 and 2000, the Company capitalized purchased software from a third party vendor and software development costs incurred under the provisions of SOP 98-1, "Accounting for the Cost of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use". Capitalized costs include only (1) external direct costs of materials and services incurred in developing or obtaining internal use software, (2) payroll and payroll-related costs for employees who are directly associated with and who devote substantial time to the internal-use software project, and (3) interest costs incurred, while developing internal-use software. Amortization began in April 2002 as portions of the project were completed, were ready for their intended purpose and were placed in service.
development cost
Research and development costs, business process re-engineering costs, training and computer software maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. Software development costs are being amortized using the straight-line method over the expected life of the product which is estimated to be five to seven years depending on when it is placed in service.
r&d
The transaction generated significant charges for in-process research and development ("IPR&D"), the write-up and subsequent write-off of purchased inventory, financing costs specific to the transaction and integration costs incurred in combining OPB in the United States with the U.S. Pharmaceutical Division ("USPD") to form U.S. Human Pharmaceuticals ("USHP"). IPR&D was valued based on estimated future cash flows for 22 individual products under development, adjusted for charges for core technology and use of existing assets. Cash flows were discounted at a rate of 15.4% and a risk adjustment factor was subsequently applied to each project based on probability of realization of the cash flows. Cash inflows from individual projects are expected to commence during the period ranging from mid-2002 to 2005, depending on the project. The estimated future cash flows are based on assumptions consistent with the OPB's historical performance. The charges can be summarized as follows:

As a result of the Acquisition, the Company has expanded its range of products and enhanced its research and development capabilities.
research and development
Facilities. USHP maintains and operates four manufacturing facilities, two research and development centers, four telemarketing facilities and two automated central distribution centers. USHP''s largest manufacturing facility is located in Baltimore, Maryland and is dedicated solely to the manufacture of liquid and nasal spray pharmaceuticals. The Company''s facility in Lincolnton, North Carolina manufactures creams, ointments and suppositories. As a result of the Acquisition, the Company acquired Purepac''s oral solid dose facility in Elizabeth, New Jersey, which manufactures tablets and capsules, and a new facility in Piscataway, New Jersey, which is in the FDA validation process for future manufacturing and which the Company anticipates will be fully functional by mid-2003. As an additional result of the Acquisition, the Company acquired a lease for a distribution center in Memphis, Tennessee, which it operates in addition to the distribution facility USHP already leased in Columbia, Maryland. USHP''s current and projected business needs do not require maintaining both distribution facilities. Therefore, the Company is devising a strategy to consolidate the distribution function in the Maryland facility. This strategy may include closing the Memphis distribution center within the next 12 months.
research and development
Facilities. The Company produces its Animal Health products in state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities. BMD is produced and blended at the Company''s Chicago Heights, Illinois facility which contains a modern fermentation and recovery plant. Albac is manufactured at the Oslo facility shared with HPI. Soluble antibiotics and vitamins are formulated in AH''s Longmont, Colorado facility and Reporcin is produced at the Company''s plant in Parkville, Australia. Feed grade chlortetracycline is produced at AH''s Hannibal, Missouri and Willow Island, West Virginia facilities in addition to being purchased from foreign suppliers. It is then blended at independent blending facilities. Bio-Cox is blended in AH''s Van Buren, Arkansas facility, and Avatec and Bovatec are blended at its Salisbury, Maryland facility. The 3-Nitro product line and Lasalocid are manufactured using the Company''s technology at separate third party facilities. These contracts require the Company to purchase minimum yearly quantities on a cost plus basis. The Company is in the process of preparing its Willow Island facility for manufacturing Lasalocid. Decoquinate, the active ingredient used in Deccox, is manufactured in accordance with a fifteen year agreement using the Company''s technology at an unrelated facility. Blending of Deccox is done at the Company''s Lowell, Arkansas plant and a third party facility. Product research and development is done at AH''s Chicago Heights, Willow Island and Oslo facilities, with an experimental farm in Wrightstown, New Jersey. The Company manufactures its fish vaccine products at its Overhalla, Norway facility and third party facilities and utilizes contract manufacturing to provide certain raw materials for vaccine production.
research and development
Scientific development is important to each of the Company''s business segments. The Company''s research, product development and technical activities in the human pharmaceuticals business within the U.S. and Norway concentrate on the development of generic equivalents of established patented products as well as discovering novel treatment uses of existing drugs. The Company''s research, product development and technical activities also focus on developing proprietary drug delivery systems, patent circumvention development in the U.S. and on improving existing delivery systems, fermentation technology and packaging and manufacturing techniques. The Company''s research and development capabilities have been enhanced and broadened as a result of the Acquisition, strengthening its ability to introduce new products and its expertise in the area of extended release products and the formulation and manufacture of oral solid dose products. In view of the substantial funds which are generally required to develop new chemical drug entities, the Company does not anticipate undertaking significant activities in this area.
research and development
Given the Company''s global presence and its focus on research and development, the Company seeks to:
research and development
reduce costs and shorten product development cycles for introduction and approval of similar products across geographic markets through the exchange of knowledge across its global research and development efforts; and
research and development
distribute its research and development, manufacturing and purchasing costs across a global platform.
research and development
Generally, research and development activities are conducted on a business segment basis. Accordingly, upon integration of the Company''s three business segments into two segments, research and development will be conducted on a two segment basis. The Company conducts its technical product development activities at its facilities in Oslo, Norway; Baltimore, Maryland; Wrightstown, New Jersey; Willow Island, West Virginia; Chicago Heights, Illinois and Elizabeth, New Jersey, as well as through independent research facilities in the U.S. and Europe. The Company closed its finished product research and development operations in Copenhagen, Denmark in 2001. However, the Copenhagen facility continues to be used for API research and development.
research and development
Research and development expenses were approximately $86.7 million, $43.3 million, and $40.2 million in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The 2001 expenses include a charge for purchased in-process research and development of $37.7 million related to the Acquisition.

In July, the Company agreed to acquire the OPB for $660.0 million (approximately $700.0 million including direct acquisition related costs and financing costs). The acquisition closed in December and resulted in significant required charges including a $37.7 million charge for in process research and development.
r&d
The OPB acquisition closed on December 12, 2001 and in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141 "Business Combinations" was accounted for by the purchase method. Required adjustments for purchase accounting included a step-up of finished goods inventory of $7.1 million of which $1.8 million was expensed as the acquired inventory was sold in December 2001. The remaining balance of $5.3 million will be expensed in the first quarter of 2002. The most significant adjustment required by purchase accounting was the valuation and write off of in-process research and development ("IPR&D"). IPR&D was valued at $37.7 million and was written off without a tax benefit (as required) resulting in a reduction of EPS of $.92. IPR&D was valued based on forecasted after tax cash flows for each potential R&D product adjusted for charges for core technology and use of existing assets. The resultant cash flows were discounted at 15.4% and subsequently reduced for a risk adjustment factor dependent on the probability of achieving the cash flows and, in certain instances, the favorable outcome of litigation.
research and development
The tax provision in 2001 was 1.8% on a pretax loss of $35.1 million due mainly to the non-deductibility of a $37.7 million in process research and development charge related to the OPB acquisition.
r&d
Research and Development ("R&D"), Including In-Process R&D ("IPR&D")
development cost
The Company's products are subject to regulation by governmental authorities, principally the Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") in the United States and equivalent authorities in international markets. Research and development expenses are charged to the consolidated statement of operations when incurred, as the Company considers that regulatory and other uncertainties inherent in the development of new products preclude it from capitalizing development costs.
r&d
Acquired products or projects which have not achieved technical feasibility (i.e., regulatory approval) are charged to the statement of operations on the date of acquisition. In connection with its acquisitions, the Company generally utilizes independent appraisers in the determination of IPR&D charges. The amount of this charge is determined based on a variety of factors including the estimated future cash flows of the product or project, the likelihood of future benefit from the product or project, and the level of risk associated with future research and development activities related to the product or project.
r&d
Cash flow from operations in 2001 was $119.4 million compared to $33.1 million and $71.6 million in 2000 and 1999, respectively. 2001 cash flow benefited from the non-cash nature of a number of items which contributed to the net loss for the year. The $37.7 million IPR&D charge, the inventory write-offs of $17.8 million, and the $7.4 million charge on exchange of the convertible debentures for Class A common stock are significant non-cash charges. Additionally, the Company reduced accounts receivable balances compared to 2000 by $26.6 million. The change in marketing strategy in AH in the 4

Operating expenses increased $56.5 million and represented 34.2% of revenues in 1999 compared to 31.4% in 1998. A major portion of the increase is attributable to the 1998 and 1999 acquisitions which include operating expenses and amortization of intangible assets acquired. Other increases included professional and consulting fees for litigation and administrative actions to attempt to reverse the European Union ban on bacitracin zinc, consulting expenses for information technology and acquisitions, expenses related to the closing of the AAHD facility in Bellevue, Washington, and increases in compensation including severance related to management changes and incentive programs. Operating expenses in 1998 include a write-off of in-process research and development of $2.1 million and $.2 million for severance related to the Cox acquisition.

Operating expenses increased by $24.1 million in 1998 on a consolidated basis. Included in 1998 operating expenses is a charge for in-process R&D of $2.1 million and IPD employee severance of $.2 million resulting from the Cox acquisition. Operating expenses in 1998 were 30.8% of revenues (31.1% including the Cox acquisition charges) compared to 32.8% of revenues in 1997. Operating expenses increased primarily due to the acquisition of Cox including goodwill amortization, increased selling and marketing expenses due to higher revenues, increased general and administrative expenses due to targeted increases in staffing and increased incentive programs offset slightly by translation of costs incurred in foreign currencies.
r&d
The provision for income taxes was 37.9% in 1998 compared to 37.3% in 1997. The slight increase in 1998 results from a 1.7% rate increase due to the write-off of in-process R&D which is not tax benefited, a .7% rate increase due to non-deductible goodwill resulting from the Cox acquisition offset partially by higher tax credits and lower statutory tax rates on foreign earnings.

Income tax expense (benefit) was $3.1 million in 2014 compared with $(0.1) million in 2013. The effective tax rate for 2014 was 19.3% compared with (1.6)% in 2013. Included in the income tax provision calculation for 2013 is a $2.4 million tax benefit, net of related uncertain tax position reserves, for research and development income tax credits earned during 2009 through 2013. This credit was not factored in the 2012 tax provision because it was not evaluated until 2013. Along with the tax benefit of research and development income tax credits, the effective tax rate is beneficially impacted by the domestic production activities deduction, offset by nondeductible deal costs related to the Met-Pro acquisition.

We focus our development efforts on designing and introducing new and improved approaches and methodologies which for our customers produce better system performance, and often improve customer process performance. For example, the patented JET*STAR strip cooler produced by Busch International routinely allows customers to increase the speed of galvanizing lines, thus enhancing productivity, while at the same time increasing product quality by, through the use of the cooling air, holding the strip more stable as the zinc coating cools. We produce specialized products that are often tailored to the specifications of a customer or application. We continually collaborate with our customers to develop the proper solution and ensure customer satisfaction. During 2012 and 2011, costs expended on research and development were not significant. Such costs are generally included as factors in determining pricing.

Federal and state income tax expense was $4.5 million in 2012 compared to $3.4 million in 2011. The effective tax rate for 2012 was 29.3% compared to 29.0% in 2011. Included in the income tax provision calculation for 2012 is a $1.1 million tax benefit, net of related uncertain tax position reserves, for research and development income tax credits earned during 2009 through 2011. This credit was not contemplated in the 2011 tax provision because it was not identified or quantified until 2012. The Company is in the process of substantiating this credit related to the additional open years of 2009 and 2011, which is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2013 and may result in additional tax benefit to be recorded in the first quarter of 2013. Along with the tax benefit of research and development income tax credits, our effective tax rate is additionally affected by certain permanent differences including non-deductible incentive stock based compensation, reversals of certain income tax reserves/deferrals, and tax holidays in foreign jurisdictions.

In 2012, $16.8 million of cash was provided by operating activities as compared to $8.7 million provided by operating activities in 2011. The $8.1 million increase in cash flow from operating activities was primarily due to a $2.5 million increase in net income from operations, the incremental cash provided of $4.0 million in Accounts Payable and Accrued Expenses, and incremental cash provided of $1.7 million in Accrued Income Taxes. In addition, the incremental cash used of $8.4 million in Accounts Receivable was offset by the incremental cash provided of $7.1 million in Costs in Excess of Billings. The cash provided by Accounts Payable and Accrued Expenses is due to efforts to better align our vendor payment terms to our customers payment terms, recording of the first year of the Adwest earn-out, and Accrued Income Taxes. Accrued Income Taxes was benefited by the research and development tax credits discussed in Note 14 accompanying the consolidated financial statements within Item 8 of this annual report.

The Company is completing a study to identify research and development expenditures over the last three years that qualify for the Federal R&D tax credit. As of March 14, 2013, that study is not yet complete; however, preliminary information indicates that $1.1 million of credit will be available upon filing amendments to income tax returns for 2009-2011. Additional credits may be identified as the study progresses. Additional credit may also be identified for 2012; however, the Federal tax credit had not been available until a January 3, 2013 retrospective reinstatement of the credit back into 2012. As such, any available credits for 2012 will not be recorded until at least the first quarter of 2013. The cost of the study is included in selling and administrative expenses.

As technology continues to evolve and next generation communications protocols are introduced, equipment manufacturers and network providers need both test and measurement products that are compatible with the new technologies and products that work with older generation equipment. We have gained significant expertise in advanced RF and new wireless technology and have focused our research and development toward such next generation technologies. One example is the Aeroflex 3000 Series, a modular test suite for mobile phone and general purpose wireless test using the PXI standard, which is a widely accepted standard for module electronic instrumentation platforms. This product is tailored to the testing of wireless handsets and wireless base stations, which are the transmission facilities for wireless networks, where speed, repeatability, and accuracy are critical. Also, as wireless infrastructure has evolved with the advent of 4G networks, ATS has built capabilities around the two main 4G standards, which are the Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access, or WiMAX, and Long Term Evolution, or LTE, protocols. In particular, we provide the TM500 product family that targets the 4G LTE market as well as PXI-based products and the 7100 product family that target both the WiMAX and LTE markets.
research and development
The volume of mobile traffic from multiple data streams is rising rapidly and has resulted in significant technological innovation to address the increasing need for higher rates of data transmission and more efficient use of existing spectrum. This has led to the development of a number of advanced data transmission systems and technologies that use RF, microwave and millimeter wave frequencies that are being used in a broad range of end markets, including space, avionics, defense, commercial wireless communications, medical and other markets. The growing number of applications in these markets, including data transmission, video transmission, control of unmanned aerial vehicles, or UAVs, and a growing number of satellites, generally are driving increased demand for RF, microwave and millimeter wave technologies. Additionally, the creation of a next generation wireless communication network to accommodate the rapidly growing volume of data being transmitted to smart phones and other mobile devices requires new test and measurement equipment for research and development, conformance testing, production testing, installation and commissioning, monitoring and optimization, and service and maintenance.

We operate in a highly competitive industry. Current and prospective customers for our products evaluate our capabilities against the merits of our direct competitors. We compete primarily on the basis of technology and performance. For certain products, we also compete on price. Some of our competitors are well-established and have greater market share and manufacturing, financial, research and development and marketing resources than we do. We also compete with emerging companies that are attempting to sell their products in specialized markets, and with the internal capabilities of many of our significant customers, including Honeywell and BAE. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our current market share with respect to any of our products. A loss of market share to our competitors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, a significant portion of our contracts, including those with the federal government and commercial customers, are subject to commercial bidding, both upon initial issuance and subsequent renewal. If we are unable to successfully compete in the bidding process or if we fail to obtain renewal, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.

Research and development expenses consist of costs related to direct product design, development and process engineering. The level of research and development expense is related to the number of products in development, the state of the development process, the complexity of the underlying technology, the potential scale of the product upon successful commercialization, the level of our exploratory research and the extent to which product development and similar costs are recoverable under contractual arrangements. We generally conduct such activities in collaboration with our customers, which provides better visibility to areas we believe will accelerate our longer term sales growth. Our basic technologies have been developed through a combination of internal development, acquisitions of businesses with technologies in similar or adjacent fields and, more recently, through licenses. Our recent acquisitions have been more of a tuck-in nature, demonstrative of a business philosophy that is not hesitant to acquire a business when it is more cost efficient to buy technology than to develop it. Licenses have primarily been used to access technology geared to a commercial application that we can translate to a radiation hardened application for use in space.

The income tax benefit was $15.3 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, an effective income tax rate of 16.7% on a consolidated pre-tax loss of $92.0 million. We had an income tax benefit for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008 of $45.8 million, an effective income tax rate of 28.5% on a consolidated pre-tax loss of $160.8 million. The effective income tax rate for both periods differed from the amount computed by applying the U.S. Federal income tax rate to income before income taxes primarily due to foreign, state and local income taxes and, for 2009, the tax benefit was decreased by $11.1 million for a non-deductible goodwill impairment charge, and for 2008, the tax benefit was decreased by $7.0 million for the impact of expenses incurred in the Going Private Transaction that were not deductible for tax purposes, as well as by $8.7 million of nondeductible in-process research and development. In the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, we paid income taxes of $3.6 million and received a tax refund of $2.3 million and in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008, we paid income taxes of $8.0 million. In May 2008, we received a federal income tax refund of $27.1 million related to the carryback of tax losses for the period July 1, 2007 to August 14, 2007, to fiscal years 2006 and 2007.

At the acquisition date, the acquired IPR&D was not considered to have reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future uses. Therefore, the fair value of the IPR&D of $24.3 million was expensed at the time of the acquisition in operating costs. The allocation to IPR&D represents the estimated fair value of such incomplete research and development, at the acquisition date, based on future cash flows. As of the acquisition date, cash flows from these projects were expected to commence in fiscal year 2009. In determining the fair values of IPR&D, risk adjusted discount rates that ranged from 17% to 25% were applied to the projects cash flows, which have taken into account the respective projects completion percentage.

research and development
We are a leading provider of highly specialized microelectronics and test and measurement equipment, primarily to the global aerospace and defense and broadband communications markets. We also design application-specific integrated circuits, or ASICs, for CT scan equipment for the medical industry. Founded in 1937, we have developed a substantial intellectual property portfolio that includes more than 150 patents, extensive know-how, years of collaborative research and development with our customers and a demonstrated history in space, validating the high quality performance of our products. We believe that the combination of our leading market positions, complementary portfolio of products, years of experience and engineering capabilities provides us with a competitive advantage and enables us to deliver high performance, high value products to our customers.
research and development
As technology continues to evolve and “next generation” broadband communications, military and commercial avionics and two-way communications protocols are introduced, equipment manufacturers and network providers require test and measurement products that are compatible with the new technologies as well as products that work with older generation equipment. In addition, wireless companies need test equipment for all stages of development: research and development and conformance testing; production testing; installation and commissioning; monitoring and optimization; and service and maintenance. We have garnered specific expertise in advanced RF and additional wireless technology and have geared our research and development and product development toward such next-generation technologies. Over the years, we have been developing advanced solutions for our customers and providing a comprehensive collection of test and measurement equipment for all stages of the network life-cycle.
research and development
RF communications is a sub-segment of wireless communications and a significant area in which we compete. In addition to being a leader in RF test equipment, we also offer a range of RF products. The total available market for RF products is anticipated to expand as developing markets continue to emerge and as data-intensive networks enable new applications, such as music players, gaming and video services. Higher data rate handsets that offer higher functionality often contain multiple radios, thereby increasing the market for RF products. Multiple-input, multiple-output technology, which is used in several future standards to increase data rates, is also expected to increase the RF content of the phone. At the same time, lower-tier handsets that are optimized for emerging markets are driving new subscriber growth, which is also increasing the market for RF products. We believe that we are well-positioned to take advantage of this growth as we currently supply an extensive line of wireless test equipment to test RF components and we have garnered specific expertise in advanced RF and additional wireless technology and have focused our research and development and product development toward such next-generation technologies.
research and development
We have strong and long-standing relationships with top-tier defense, aerospace and broadband customers, including a significant number of defense-related technology companies. Our close customer relationships have enabled us to engage in collaborative product development over multi-year product life-cycles, build our intellectual property portfolio and develop critical product and end-market expertise, resulting in higher switching costs for our customers. We believe our long track record of design successes with our customers further benefits our ability to: (i) solidify our position as a sole source or primary supplier of products to customers across a wide array of programs; (ii) enjoy long multi-year platform relationships; (iii) maximize the effectiveness of our research and development spending; and (iv) minimize our customers’ product development time. Our customers include the five prime defense contractors (Boeing, General Dynamics, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman and Raytheon), as well as BAE, Cisco, Nokia, Motorola and Teradyne. Our products are used by customers in various aerospace and defense and broadband communications programs, providing us with increased revenue diversification and stability. In fiscal 2009, our largest customer represented approximately 9% of our net sales, demonstrating the diversity of our customer base. In addition to our diverse product base, we believe that we are well-positioned in domestic and international growth markets and believe that our geographic and product diversification helps to reduce the risk associated with the volatility of any one particular region or market segment.
research and development
We continue to allocate research and development spending toward new products serving large and/or growing markets. We endeavor to introduce new products to the market that allow us to move up to more profitable systems and products. We have transitioned from providing simple components, such as semiconductors, to more integrated products, including board-level and system-level products. Examples of recent new products include ASICs, satellite power subsystems and microwave/RF modules and receivers. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, we invested 11.7% of our net sales into self-funded research and development efforts. Examples of new product opportunities that we are pursuing are the CT scan market and the synthetic test market.
research and development
We plan to continue to improve our fixed cost position by critically examining the profitability of our operations and consolidating operations across facilities where operational synergies exist. In fiscal 2006, we implemented a plan to restructure our European businesses by consolidating a majority of our U.K. manufacturing operations into our Stevenage, England facility. In fiscal 2008, we continued to restructure our U.K. operations by further rationalizing duplicative research and development and selling, general and administrative activities, which resulted in the closure of our Burnham, England facility and relocation of its operations to Stevenage, England. In May 2008, we sold our radar system development and manufacturing business, or the Radar Division, which had been operating at a significant loss. We will continue to examine our operations for opportunities to further reduce costs, divest non-strategic businesses, increase cash flow and improve our margins.
research and development
We will continue to seek accretive acquisitions that provide complementary products and services, enhance our intellectual property and customer base, and provide entry into high-growth adjacent markets. We view our acquisition strategy as an extension of our research and development and marketing efforts. Recent strategic acquisitions in both the AMS and ATS segments have broadened and strengthened our product offering and technology portfolio. Since 2002, we have acquired 12 businesses and plan to opportunistically continue our disciplined approach to seeking accretive acquisitions. For instance:

As of June 30, 2009, we had approximately 800 engineers conducting research and development activities at 17 of our facilities.
research and development
Our research and development efforts primarily involve engineering and design relating to:
research and development
We emphasize research and development efforts for products in both the AMS and ATS divisions. In AMS, we have geared our research and development capabilities toward continually introducing new, high value products, including the planned introduction of power subsystems and microwave/RF Modules and microreceivers between 2007 and 2009, enabling us to increase the number of our products embedded into modern satellites. In ATS, we are developing technologies that are used in the next generation of wireless infrastructure. Our research and development consists of self-funded research and development as well as research and development we conduct in collaboration with or on behalf of our customers.
research and development
Certain product development and similar costs are recoverable under contractual arrangements and those that are not recoverable are expensed in the year incurred. We invested $70.1 million in self funded research and development for fiscal 2009, $82.1 million for fiscal 2008 and $76.7 million for fiscal 2007.
research and development
We operate in a highly competitive industry. Current and prospective customers for our products evaluate our capabilities against the merits of our direct competitors. For all of our products, we compete primarily on the basis of both performance and price. Some of our competitors are well-established and have greater market share and manufacturing, financial, research and development and marketing resources than we do. We also compete with emerging companies that are attempting to sell their products in specialized markets, and with the internal capabilities of many of our significant customers, including Honeywell and BAE. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our current market share with respect to any of our products. A loss of market share to our competitors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, a significant portion of our contracts, including those with the federal government and commercial customers, are subject to commercial bidding, both upon initial issuance and recompetition. If we are unable to successfully compete in the bidding process or if we fail to obtain renewal, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.

. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008 and in connection with the Company Sale Transaction, we recorded and immediately expensed $24.3 million of acquired in-process research and development (“IPR&D”) costs ($15.7 million in the AMS segment and $8.6 million in the ATS segment). Additionally, in 2009 and 2008, we recorded and expensed $1.7 million and $635,000, respectively, of IPR&D costs related to our acquisition of Gaisler (AMS segment) in June 2008 based on the final allocation of the purchase price.
r&d
The AMS segment incurred total restructuring costs of $414,000 ($107,000 in cost of sales, $272,000 in S,G&A and $35,000 in R&D), in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008 which relate to severance for personnel reductions at our Whippany, New Jersey components manufacturing facility.
r&d
The ATS segment incurred restructuring costs of $4.1 million in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009 ($2.9 million in cost of sales, $686,000 in S,G&A and $496,000 in R&D). In comparison, in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008, the ATS segment incurred restructuring costs of $10.4 million ($880,000 in cost of sales, $3.5 million in S,G&A and $6.0 million in R&D). In both periods, the costs related to consolidation and reorganization efforts in our U.K. operations.

The income tax benefit was $15.3 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, an effective income tax rate of 16.7%. We had an income tax benefit for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008 of $45.8 million, an effective income tax rate of 28.5%. The effective income tax rate for both periods differed from the amount computed by applying the U.S. Federal income tax rate to income before income taxes primarily due to foreign, state and local income taxes and, for 2009, the tax benefit was decreased by $11.1 million for a non-deductible goodwill impairment charge, and for 2008, the tax benefit was decreased by $5.9 million for the impact of certain Company Sale Transaction expenses that were not deductible for tax purposes, as well as by $8.7 million nondeductible IPR&D. In the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, we paid income taxes of $3.6 million and received a tax refund of $2.3 million and in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008, we paid income taxes of $8.0 million. In May 2008, we received a federal income tax refund of $27.1 million related to the carryback of tax losses for the period July 1, 2007 to August 14, 2007, to fiscal years 2006 and 2007.

The AMS segment incurred restructuring costs of $414,000 in fiscal 2008 ($107,000 in cost of sales, $272,000 in S,G&A and $35,000 in R&D) related to severance for personnel reductions within its IP products division. Restructuring costs in ATS of $10.4 million ($880,000 in cost of sales, $3.5 million in S,G&A and $6.0 million in R&D) relate to further consolidation and reorganization efforts in our U.K. operations. In comparison, in fiscal 2007 we incurred total restructuring costs of $2.8 million, all of which was reported in the ATS segment as R&D expense.
r&d
The income tax benefit was $45.8 million, an effective income tax rate of 28.5%, in fiscal 2008. In fiscal 2007 we had income tax expense of $24.9 million, an effective income tax rate of 73.9%. The effective income tax rate for the two periods differed from the amount computed by applying the U.S. Federal income tax rate to income before income taxes primarily due to foreign, state and local income taxes and the impact of certain Company Sale Transaction expenses that were not deductible for tax purposes in fiscal 2008 and 2007, as well as nondeductible IPR&D in fiscal 2008. We paid income taxes of $8.0 million in fiscal 2008 and $28.8 million in fiscal 2007. In May 2008, we received a federal income tax refund of $27.1 million related to the carryback of tax losses for the period July 1, 2007 to August 14, 2007, to fiscal years 2006 and 2007.
r&d
The loss from continuing operations in fiscal 2008 was $115.0 million versus income of $8.8 million in fiscal 2007. Income (loss) from continuing operations in fiscal 2008 was adversely affected by the following pre-tax items: $41.6 million of Company Sale Transaction and related expenses (including $5.4 million reported in S,G&A), an increase in interest expense of $74.3 million, an increase in restructuring charges of $7.9 million, the current period impact of purchase accounting adjustments to inventory, depreciation and deferred revenue totaling $45.6 million, an IPR&D charge of $25.0 million, and an increase in intangible asset amortization of $61.8 million. Income (loss) from continuing operations in fiscal 2007 was adversely affected by $30.6 million of Company Sale Transaction expenses.
development cost
We charge all research and development costs to expense as incurred, except those of our software products for which costs incurred between the date of product technological feasibility and the date that the software is available for general release are capitalized. We use a working model of the software or a detailed program design to assess technological feasibility. We capitalized software development costs of $209,000, $1.2 million, $0 and $593,000, for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, the periods from August 15, 2007 to June 30, 2008 and July 1, 2007 to August 14, 2007 and the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007, respectively. Capitalized software development costs are amortized to cost of sales based on the higher of a) the percentage of revenue for units delivered to total anticipated revenue for the related product, or b) on a straight-line basis. Capitalized software development costs of $328,000 and $1.2 million were included in other assets at June 30, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

At the acquisition date, the acquired in-process research and development (“IPR&D”) was not considered to have reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future uses. Therefore, the fair value of the IPR&D of $24.3 million was expensed at the time of the acquisition in operating costs. The allocation to IPR&D represents the estimated fair value of such incomplete research and development, at the acquisition date, based on future cash flows. As of the acquisition date, cash flows from these projects were expected to commence in fiscal year 2009. In determining the fair values of IPR&D, risk adjusted discount rates that ranged from 17% to 25% were applied to the projects’ cash flows, which have taken into account the respective projects’ completion percentage.

In fiscal 2007, we initiated and completed restructuring activity in the Wireless division of our Test Solutions businesses in the United Kingdom. Pursuant to the plan, 23 employees were terminated, resulting in $1.4 million of severance costs, and certain contract positions were eliminated. We also abandoned a leased facility and recorded a fixed asset impairment charge, which in the aggregate amounted to $1.3 million. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007, we recorded approximately $2.8 million in restructuring costs including the write-off of $753,000 of net fixed assets, all in research and development costs except for $35,000 allocated to selling, general and administrative costs, and all of which was paid as of June 30, 2007.
development cost
In fiscal 2008, we initiated additional actions to restructure our U.K. business units by further consolidating our manufacturing, research and development and selling, general and administrative activities. In addition, we initiated a restructuring in our Whippany, New Jersey, component manufacturing facility to address a slowdown in sales of its integrated products line. These actions resulted in the termination of approximately 120 employees, which resulted in restructuring costs, principally severance, for the periods from August 15, 2007 to June 30, 2008 and July 1, 2007 to August 14, 2007 of $7.0 million ($987,000 in cost of sales, $2.1 million in selling, general and administrative costs and $3.9 million in research and development costs) and $3.8 million ($1.6 million in selling, general and administrative costs and $2.2 million in research and development costs), respectively. Substantially all of the workforce reduction costs were paid prior to June 30, 2008. Facility closure costs include $2.6 million of accrued contractual commitments under operating leases for two facilities in the U.K. that we exited in May 2008, which will be paid through December 2010. Included in the restructuring costs was approximately $485,000 of fixed asset impairment charges that were recorded in selling, general and administrative costs in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 for the write-off of leasehold improvements in the abandoned facilities.
development cost
For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, in connection with continued restructuring activities of certain manufacturing operations, we incurred $3.8 million of severance costs for an additional 103 employees terminated primarily in our U.K. business unit and $294,000 of facility closure costs ($2.9 million in cost of sales, $686,000 in selling, general and administrative costs and $496,000 in research and development costs).

Self-funded research and development costs increased $1.6 million, or 7%, in the AMS segment primarily due to the increased development of integrated circuits. Research and development costs increased $12.9 million, or 34%, in the ATS segment primarily due to the addition of the expense of SPG ($9.3 million) and the development of a radar tracking system ($5.2 million).

The income tax provision was $17.2 million (an effective income tax rate of 38.0%) in fiscal 2006 and $14.4 million (an effective income tax rate of 43.5%) in fiscal 2005. The effective income tax rate for the two periods differed from the amount computed by applying the U.S. Federal income tax rate to income before income taxes primarily due to foreign, state and local income taxes, and research and development credits, non-repatriated foreign earnings and non-deductible in-process research and development costs. The primary difference in rates between the two years is due to a manufacturing credit in 2006 and a non deductible in-process research and development charge in 2005.
research and development
Income from continuing operations for the year ended June 30, 2006 was $28.1 million, or $.37 per diluted share, versus $18.6 million, or $.25 per diluted share, in 2005. Fiscal 2006 income from continuing operations included a $6.8 million ($4.2 million after tax) charge for share based compensation in fiscal 2006 (for which there was no comparable expense in the prior year). Fiscal 2005 income from continuing operations included a $3.0 million charge ($3.0 million, net of tax) for in-process research and development related to the acquisitions of JcAIR, and SPG.
development cost
Self funded research and development costs increased $7.4 million, or 46%, in the AMS segment primarily due to the increased development cost associated with field programmable gate arrays ($3.8 million) and microelectronic modules ($1.4 million) and to a lesser degree, the inclusion of MCE for a full year versus ten months in fiscal 2004 ($1.2 million).
development cost
increased $4.0 million, or 12%, in the ATS segment primarily due to the addition of the developmental expenses for wireless communication test equipment, which is expected to continue to have higher research and development costs.

In connection with the acquisition of SPG, we allocated $2.8 million of the purchase price to incomplete research and development projects. In connection with the acquisition of JcAIR, we allocated $200,000 of the purchase price to incomplete research and development projects. These allocations represented the estimated fair value of such incomplete research and development projects, at the acquisition date, based on future cash flows that have been adjusted by the respective projects completion percentage. At the respective acquisition dates, the development of these projects had not yet reached technological feasibility and the research and development in progress had no alternative future uses. Accordingly, we expensed these costs as of the respective acquisition dates in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
development cost
The income tax provision was $14.4 million (an effective income tax rate of 43.5%) in fiscal 2005 and $12.5 million (an effective income tax rate of 37.8%) in fiscal 2004. The effective income tax rate for the two periods differed from the amount computed by applying the U.S. Federal income tax rate to income before income taxes primarily due to foreign, state and local income taxes, research and development credits and non-deductible in-process research and development costs. The primary difference in rates between the two years is due to the increase in domestic income relative to foreign income and a valuation allowance recorded on foreign losses. Domestic income is taxed at higher effective tax rates than foreign income which increases the overall global tax rate.
research and development
Income from continuing operations for the year ended June 30, 2005 was $18.6 million, or $.25 per diluted share, versus $20.5 million, or $.29 per diluted share, in 2004. Fiscal 2005 income from continuing operations included a $3.0 million charge ($3.0 million, net of tax) for in-process research and development related to the acquisitions of JcAIR and SPG. Fiscal 2004 income from continuing operations included a $4.2 million charge ($3.9 million, net of tax) for in-process research and development related to the acquisitions of MCE, RIWS and Celerity.

The developed technology and customer related intangibles are being amortized on a straight-line basis over a range of 3 to 15 years. The goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes. At the acquisition date, we expensed the value of the acquired in-process research and development because it was not considered to have reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future uses. The allocation to in-process research and development represents the estimated fair value of such incomplete research and development, at the acquisition date, based on future cash flows that have been adjusted by the respective projects completion percentage. As of the acquisition date, cash flows from these projects were expected to commence in fiscal 2006. A 24% risk adjusted discount rate was applied to the projects cash flows in determining fair value. At the acquisition date, JcAIR was conducting development activities associated with the completion of the Mode 5 General Avionic Test Equipment sets.

The allocation to in-process research and development represents the estimated fair value of such incomplete research and development, at the acquisition date, based on future cash flows that have been adjusted by the respective projects completion percentage. As of the acquisition date, cash flows from these projects were expected to commence in fiscal year 2006. As of the acquisition date, cash flows were expected under two scenarios  base case (assuming the contingent payment is not earned) and earnout case (assuming the contingent payment is earned). In determining fair value, a 24% risk adjusted discount rate was applied to the projects cash flows under the base case, and a 40% risk adjusted discount rate was applied to the projects cash flows under the earnout case. At the acquisition date, SPG was conducting development activities associated with the completion of test mobile products used to test evolving 3G (third-generation) mobile communications networks and equipment that tests the functionality and performance of Wide-Band-Code-Division-Multiple-Access technology.

Certain product development and similar costs are recoverable under contractual arrangements and those that are not recoverable are expensed in the year incurred. The costs of our self-funded research activities were approximately $61.4 million for fiscal 2005, $50.0 million for fiscal 2004, and $29.5 million for fiscal 2003. The increase in fiscal 2005 from fiscal 2004 is primarily attributable to increased development costs associated with field programmable gate arrays ($3.8 million) and microelectronic modules ($1.4 million), the inclusion of MCE for a full year versus ten months last year ($1.2 million), and increased development expense for wireless communication test equipment ($3.3 million). The increase in fiscal 2004 from 2003 is primarily attributable to additional expense of MCE, RIWS and Celerity. In connection with our SPG and JcAIR acquisitions in fiscal 2005, we allocated $2.8 million and $200,000, respectively, of the purchase price to in-process research and development projects. In connection with our acquisitions of MCE, RIWS and Celerity in fiscal 2004, we allocated $420,000, $2.7 million and $1.1 million, respectively, of the purchase price to in-process research and development projects.

Self-funded research and development costs increased $7.1 million, or 46%, in the AMS segment primarily due to the increased development cost associated with field programmable gate arrays ($3.8 million) and microelectronic modules ($1.4 million), and to a lesser degree, the inclusion of MCE for a full year versus ten months last year ($1.2 million). Research and development costs increased $4.3 million, or 13%, in the ATS segment primarily due to the addition of the developmental expenses for wireless communication test equipment, which is expected to continue to have higher research and development costs.

Acquired in-Process Research and Development.
research and development
In connection with the acquisition of SPG, we allocated $2.8 million of the purchase price to incomplete research and development projects. In connection with the acquisition of JcAIR, we allocated $200,000 of the purchase price to incomplete research and development projects. These allocations represent the estimated fair value of such incomplete research and development projects, at the acquisition date, based on future cash flows that have been adjusted by the respective projects completion percentage. At the respective acquisition dates, the development of these projects had not yet reached technological feasibility and the research and development in progress had no alternative future uses. Accordingly, we expensed these costs as of the respective acquisition dates in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
research and development
At its acquisition date, SPG expected to spend approximately $2.2 million to complete all phases of the research and development, with anticipated completion dates ranging from two to five months from that date. At its acquisition date, JcAIR expected to spend approximately $900,000 to complete all phases of the research and development, with anticipated completion dates ranging from fifteen to twenty months from that date.
research and development
Revenue growth rates for the acquired companies were estimated based on a detailed forecast, as well as discussions with the finance, marketing and engineering personnel of the acquired companies. Allocation of total projected revenues to in-process research and development were based on discussions with the acquired companies management. Selling, general and administrative expenses and profitability estimates were determined based on forecasts as well as an analysis of comparable companies margin expectations.
development cost
We believe that the foregoing assumptions used in the forecasts were reasonable at the time of the acquisitions. No assurance can be given, however, that the underlying assumptions used to estimate sales, development costs or profitability, or the events associated with such projects will transpire as estimated. For these reasons, actual results may vary from projected results.
research and development
Remaining development efforts for the acquired companies research and development included various phases of design, development and testing. Funding for such projects is expected to come primarily from internally generated sources.
research and development
As evidenced by the continued support of the development of these projects, we believe we have a reasonable chance of successfully completing the research and development programs. However, as with all of our technology development, there is a risk associated with the completion of the research and development projects, and there is no assurance that technological or commercial success will be achieved.
research and development
If the development of these in-process research and development projects is unsuccessful, our sales and profitability may be adversely affected in future periods. Commercial results are also subject to certain market events and risks, which are beyond our control, such as trends in technology, changes in government regulation, market size and growth, and product introduction or other actions by competitors.

The income tax provision was $14.4 million (an effective income tax rate of 43.5%) in fiscal 2005 and $12.5 million (an effective income tax rate of 37.8%) in fiscal 2004. The effective income tax rate for the two periods differed from the amount computed by applying the U.S. Federal income tax rate to income before income taxes primarily due to foreign, state and local income taxes, and research and development credits and non-deductible in-process research and development costs. The primary difference in rates between the two years is due to the increase in domestic income relative to foreign income and a valuation allowance recorded on foreign losses. Domestic income is taxed at higher effective tax rates than foreign income which increases the overall global tax rate.

Income from continuing operations for the year ended June 30, 2005 was $18.6 million, or $.25 per diluted share, versus $20.5 million, or $.29 per diluted share, in 2004. Fiscal 2005 income from continuing operations included a $3.0 million charge ($3.0 million, net of tax, or $.04 per diluted share), for in-process research and development related to the acquisitions of JcAIR and SPG. Fiscal 2004 income from continuing operations included a $4.2 million charge ($3.9 million, net of tax, or $.06 per diluted share) for in-process research and development related to the acquisitions of MCE, RIWS and Celerity.

Fiscal 2002 income from continuing operations included a $9.1 million charge ($5.8 million, net of tax) or $.09 per diluted share, for restructuring charges related to the consolidation of certain operations and a $1.1 million charge ($1.1 million, net of tax) or $.02 per diluted share, for in-process research and development related to the acquisition of IFR Systems, Inc.
development cost
Our self-funded research and development costs increased 23.1% to $23.1 million (11.4% of net sales) in fiscal 2002 from $18.8 million (8.1% of net sales) in fiscal 2001. The increase was primarily due to UTMC's efforts toward the development of new integrated circuits and the additional expenses of IFR.
research and development
In connection with the acquisition of IFR, we allocated $1.1 million of the purchase price to incomplete research and development projects. This allocation represents the estimated fair value based on future cash flows that have been adjusted by the projects' completion percentage. At the acquisition date, the development of these projects had not yet reached technological feasibility and the research and development in progress had no alternative future uses. Accordingly, we expensed these costs as of the acquisition date.
research and development
At its acquisition date, IFR expected to spend approximately $3.5 million to complete all phases of the research and development, with anticipated completion dates ranging from 5 to 10 months from that date.
research and development
Revenue growth rates for the acquired company were estimated based on a detailed forecast, as well as discussions with the finance, marketing and engineering personnel of IFR. Allocation of total projected revenues to in-process research and development was based on discussions with IFR's management. Selling, general and administrative expenses and profitability estimates were determined based on forecasts as well as an analysis of comparable companies' margin expectations.
development cost
We believe that the foregoing assumptions used in the forecasts were reasonable at the time of the acquisition. No assurance can be given, however, that the underlying assumptions used to estimate sales, development costs or profitability, or the events associated with such projects will transpire as estimated. For these reasons, actual results may vary from projected results.
research and development
Remaining development efforts for IFR's research and development included various phases of design, development and testing. Funding for such projects is expected to come primarily from internally generated sources.
research and development
As evidenced by the continued support of the development of IFR's projects, we believe we have a reasonable chance of successfully completing the research and development programs. However, as with all of our technology development, there is risk associated with the completion of the research and development projects, and there is no assurance that technological or commercial success will be achieved.
research and development
If the development of these in-process research and development projects is unsuccessful, our sales and profitability may be adversely affected in future periods. Commercial results are also subject to certain market events and risks, which are beyond our control, such as trends in technology, changes in government regulation, market size and growth, and product introduction or other actions by competitors.

The income tax provision was $50,000 (an effective income tax rate of 13.4%) in fiscal 2002 and the income tax provision was $11.8 million (an effective income tax rate of 34.0%) in fiscal 2001. The income tax provisions for the two periods differed from the amount computed by applying the U.S. Federal income tax rate to income before income taxes primarily due to non-deductible charges for acquired in-process R&D and amortization of goodwill, state and local income taxes and research and development credits.

On a U.S. GAAP basis, income from continuing operations for the year ended June 30, 2002 was $324,000 or $.01 per diluted share versus $22.9 million or $.37 per diluted share. Income from continuing operations for the year ended June 30, 2002 includes a restructuring charge of $9.1 million ($5.8 million, net of tax) or $.09 per diluted share and a charge of $1.1 million ($1.1 million, net of tax) or $.02 per diluted share for in-process research and development. Income from continuing operations for the year ended June 30, 2001 includes a charge for in-process research and development of $1.5 million ($1.0 million, net of tax) or $.02 per diluted share.

Our research and development efforts primarily involve engineering and design relating to:
development cost
Certain product development and similar costs are recoverable under contractual arrangements and those that are not recoverable are expensed in the year incurred. The costs of our self-funded research activities were approximately $23.7 million for fiscal 2002, $18.9 million for fiscal 2001 and $11.6 million for fiscal 2000. The increases are primarily attributable to UTMC's efforts toward the development of new integrated circuits and the addition of the expenses of IFR. Also, in connection with our acquisition of IFR Systems, Inc. in fiscal 2002, we allocated $1.1 million of the purchase price to incomplete research and development projects. In connection with our acquisitions of RDL, Inc. and TriLink Communications Corp. in fiscal 2001, we allocated $1.5 million (for RDL) and $1.0 million (for TriLink) of the purchase prices to incomplete research and development projects. Since the research and development projects had not reached technological feasibility at the time of the acquisition, these amounts were charged to expense, in the respective years of acquisition, in addition to the self-funded research and development costs, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

Provision (Benefit) for Income Taxes. The income tax benefit was $3.0 million (an effective income tax rate of 21.5%) in fiscal 2002 and the income tax provision was $11.5 million (an effective income tax rate of 35.0%) in fiscal 2001. The income tax provisions for the two periods differed from the amount computed by applying the U.S. Federal income tax rate to income before income taxes primarily due to non-deductible charges for acquired in-process R&D and impairment and amortization of goodwill, state and local income taxes and research and development credits.

Net Income (Loss). On a pro forma basis, net income for the year ended June 30, 2002 was $5.2 million, or $.08 per share, versus net income of $23.3 million, or $.38 per diluted share, for the year ended June 30, 2001. Pro forma net income for fiscal 2002 excludes restructuring charges for the consolidation of certain manufacturing operations of $20.1 million ($14.9 million, net of tax), or $.25 per share, and excludes an in-process research and development write-off of $1.1 million ($1.1 million, net of tax) or $.02 per share. For fiscal 2001, pro forma net income excludes in-process research and development write-offs of $2.5 million ($2.0 million, net of tax), or $.03 per diluted share. On a U.S. GAAP basis, our net loss for the year ended June 30, 2002 was $10.8 million, or $.18 per share, versus net income of $21.4 million, or $.35 per diluted share, in 2001.

Certain product development and similar costs are recoverable under contractual arrangements and those that are not recoverable are expensed in the year incurred. The costs of our self-funded research activities were approximately $18.9 million for fiscal 2001, $11.6 million for fiscal 2000 and $10.1 million for fiscal 1999. The increases are primarily attributable to the addition of the expenses of our newly acquired companies and increased costs for the further development of frequency synthesizers and high speed automatic test systems. Also, in connection with our acquisitions of RDL, Inc. and TriLink Communications Corp. in fiscal 2001, we allocated $1.5 million (for RDL) and $1.0 million (for TriLink) of the purchase prices to incomplete research and development projects. In connection with our acquisition of UTMC Microelectronic Systems in February 1999, we allocated $3.5 million of the purchase price to incomplete research and development projects. Since the research and development projects had not reached technological feasibility at the time of the acquisition, these amounts were charged to expense in the respective years in addition to the self-funded research and development costs, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

Research and Development Costs. Research and development costs include material, engineering labor and allocated overhead. Our self-funded research and development costs increased 63.1% to $18.9 million (8.1% of net sales) in fiscal 2001 from $11.6 million (6.1% of net sales) in fiscal 2000. The increase was primarily due to the addition of the expenses of RDL and increased development efforts in frequency synthesizers and high speed automatic test systems.

Acquired In-Process Research and Development. In connection with the acquisition of RDL, Inc., we allocated $1.5 million of the purchase price to incomplete research and development projects. In connection with the acquisition of TriLink Communications Corp., we allocated $1.0 million of the purchase price to incomplete research and development projects. These allocations represent the estimated fair value based on future cash flows that have been adjusted by the respective project's completion percentage. At the respective acquisition dates, the development of these projects had not yet reached technological feasibility and the research and development in progress had no alternative future uses. Accordingly, we expensed these costs as of the respective acquisition dates.
research and development
At its acquisition date, RDL expected to spend approximately $1.3 million to complete all phases of the research and development, with anticipated completion dates ranging from 13 to 17 months from that date. At its acquisition date, TriLink expected to spend approximately $200,000 to complete the research and development, with an anticipated completion date between 6 and 9 months from that date.
research and development
Revenue growth rates for the acquired companies were estimated based on a detailed forecast, as well as discussions with the finance, marketing and engineering personnel of the acquired companies. Allocation of total projected revenues to in-process research and development was based on discussions with the acquired companies' management. Selling, general and administrative expenses and profitability estimates were determined based on forecasts as well as an analysis of comparable companies' margin expectations.

We believe that the foregoing assumptions used in the forecasts were reasonable at the time of the acquisition. No assurance can be given, however, that the underlying assumptions used to estimate sales, development costs or profitability, or the events associated with such projects will transpire as estimated. For these reasons, actual results may vary from projected results.

As evidenced by the continued support of the development of the acquired companies' projects, we believe we have a reasonable chance of successfully completing the research and development programs. However, as with all of our technology development, there is risk associated with the completion of the research and development projects, and there is no assurance that technological or commercial success will be achieved.
research and development
If the development of these in-process research and development projects is unsuccessful, our sales and profitability may be adversely affected in future periods. Commercial results are also subject to certain market events and risks, which are beyond our control, such as trends in technology, changes in government regulation, market size and growth, and product introduction or other actions by competitors.

Provision for Income Taxes. Income taxes increased 84.7% to $11.5 million (an effective income tax rate of 34.0%, exclusive of the non-deductible $1.0 million charge for the acquired in-process R&D for TriLink) in fiscal 2001 from $7.2 million (an effective income tax rate of 35.0%), excluding a $1.0 million benefit from the utilization of a capital loss carryforward, in fiscal 2000. The income tax provisions for the two periods differed from the amount computed by applying the U.S. Federal income tax rate to income before income taxes primarily due to state and local income taxes and research and development credits.

Research and Development Costs. Our self-funded research and development costs increased 15.3% to $11.6 million (6.1% of net sales) in fiscal 2000 from $10.1 million (6.3% of net sales) in fiscal 1999. This increase was primarily attributable to the additional costs of UTMC Microelectronic Systems, partially offset by reduced costs, relative to the prior year, related to the development of the FS-1000, a low-cost, high speed, high performance frequency synthesizer intended for commercial communication test systems, which was completed in early fiscal 2000.

Provision for Income Taxes. Income taxes were $7.2 million (an effective income tax rate of 35.0%), excluding a $1.0 million benefit from the utilization of a capital loss carryforward, in fiscal 2000, and $7.2 million (an effective income tax rate of 35.0%, exclusive of the non-deductible $3.5 million charge for the acquired in-process R&D for UTMC) in fiscal 1999. The income tax provisions in fiscal 2000 and 1999 were different from the amounts computed by applying the U.S. Federal income tax rate to income before income taxes primarily due to state and local income taxes and research and development credits.

In May 2000, we sold 6.3 million shares (adjusted for a five-for-four stock split and a two-for-one stock split) of our common stock in a public offering for $68.5 million, net of an underwriting discount of $3.5 million and issuance costs of $500,000. Of these net proceeds, $13.0 million was used to repay the term loan. The balance of the net proceeds is invested in short-term marketable securities and is intended to be used ultimately for additional working capital, including research and development, for expansion of our facilities, and for general corporate purposes, including possible acquisitions of technologies, product lines or businesses.

Certain product development and similar costs are recoverable under contractual arrangements and those that are not recoverable are expensed in the year incurred. The costs of our self-funded research activities were approximately $11.0 million for fiscal 2000, $9.6 million for fiscal 1999 and $5.2 million for fiscal 1998. The increases are primarily attributable to our development of a low-cost, high-speed, high-performance frequency synthesizer intended for commercial communication test systems as well as, for fiscal 2000 and 1999, the addition of the expenses of Aeroflex UTMC Microelectronic Systems. Also, in connection with our acquisition of UTMC Microelectronic Systems in February 1999, we allocated $3.5 million of the purchase price to incomplete research and development projects. Since the research and development projects had not reached technological feasibility, $3.5 million was charged to expense in fiscal 1999 in addition to the $9.6 million, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
research and development
We believe that to remain competitive in the future, we will need to invest significant financial resources in research and development.

Research and Development Costs. Research and development costs include material, engineering labor and allocated overhead. Our self-funded research and development costs increased 14.2% to $11.0 million (5.9% of net sales) in fiscal 2000 from $9.6 million (6.1% of net sales) in fiscal 1999. This increase was primarily attributable to the additional costs of UTMC Microelectronic Systems, partially offset by reduced costs, relative to the prior year, related to the development of the FS- 1000, a low-cost, high speed, high performance frequency synthesizer intended for commercial communication test systems, which was completed in early fiscal 2000.

Research and Development Costs. Our self-funded research and development costs increased 85.8% to $9.6 million (6.1% of net sales) in fiscal 1999 from $5.2 million (4.4% of net sales) in fiscal 1998. This increase was primarily attributable to the addition of the expenses of UTMC Microelectronic Systems and the costs for continued development of a low-cost, high speed, high performance frequency synthesizer intended for commercial communication test systems.

Acquired In-Process Research and Development. In connection with the acquisition of UTMC Microelectronic Systems, we allocated $3.5 million of the purchase price to incomplete research and development projects. This allocation represents the estimated fair value based on future cash flows that have been adjusted by the projects' completion percentage. At the acquisition date, the development of these projects had not yet reached technological feasibility and the research and development in progress had no alternative future uses. Accordingly, we expensed these costs as of the acquisition date.
research and development
We used an independent third-party appraiser to assess and value the in-process research and development. The value assigned to this asset was determined by identifying significant research projects for which technological feasibility had not been established. In the case of UTMC Microelectronic Systems, this included the design, development, and testing activities associated with its commercial products, data bus products, radiation hardened
research and development
products and application specific integrated circuits. The research and development projects are associated with the introduction of several new products as well as specific significant enhancements to existing products. Valuation of development efforts in the future has been excluded from the research and development appraisal.
research and development
Revenue growth rates for UTMC Microelectronic Systems were estimated by the third party appraiser based on a detailed forecast we prepared, as well as the appraiser's discussions with our finance, marketing and engineering personnel and those of UTMC Microelectronic Systems. Allocation of total UTMC Microelectronic Systems' projected revenues to in-process research and development was based on the appraiser's discussions with UTMC Microelectronic Systems' management and us. A significant portion of UTMC Microelectronic Systems' future revenues was expected to originate from the sale of products that were not yet completed at acquisition. However, UTMC Microelectronic Systems' existing products and technologies are expected to generate sales through 2008.
development cost
We believe that the foregoing assumptions used in the forecasts were reasonable at the time of the acquisition. No assurance can be given, however, that the underlying assumptions used to estimate sales, development costs or profitability, or the events associated with such projects will transpire as estimated. For these reasons, actual results may vary from projected results.
research and development
Remaining development efforts for UTMC Microelectronic Systems' research and development include various phases of design, development and testing. Funding for such projects is expected to come from internally generated sources.

As evidenced by the continued support of the development of its projects, we believe we have a reasonable chance of successfully completing the research and development programs. However, as with all of our technology development, there is risk associated with the completion of the UTMC Microelectronic Systems' research and development projects, and there is no assurance that technological or commercial success will be achieved.

If the development of UTMC Microelectronic Systems' in-process research and development project is unsuccessful, our sales and profitability may be adversely affected in future periods. Commercial results are also subject to certain market events and risks, which are beyond our control, such as trends in technology, changes in government regulation, market size and growth, and product introduction or other actions by competitors.

Provision for Income Taxes. Income taxes increased 50.5% to $7.2 million (an effective income tax rate of 35.0%, exclusive of the special charge) in fiscal 1999, from $4.8 million (an effective income tax rate of 36.1%) in fiscal 1998. The income tax provisions for the years ended June 30, 1999 and 1998 were different from the amounts computed by applying the U.S. Federal income tax rate to income before income taxes primarily due to state and local income taxes and research and development credits, and for the year ended June 30, 1999, due to the non-deductibility of the $3.5 million special charge.

research and development
We have research and development locations in Czechia, France, Germany, India, Israel, Japan, Malaysia, South Korea, the United Kingdom and the United States, although a certain level of innovation occurs at every one of our manufacturing sites. We developed numerous new products and product extensions during fiscal 2019 in addition to those added through our acquisition activity. These new products add to the broad product line we offer to our customers. Our research scientists and design engineers are working to develop product solutions to the challenges facing our customers as consumers and businesses demand more advanced electronic solutions to manage their everyday lives and businesses. Our engineers are continually working to enhance our manufacturing processes to improve capability, capacity, and yield, while reducing manufacturing costs.
research and development
We also manufacture and resell a broad line of advanced electronic components to fill the special needs of our customers. Our family of advanced components includes specialized ceramic, tantalum and film capacitors, polymer and EDLC capacitors, high energy/voltage power capacitors, passive and active antennas and varistors. Our advanced product engineers work with some customers’ in-house technical staffs to design and manufacture customized products to meet the specifications of particular applications. The manufacture of custom products permits us, through our research and development activities, to make technological advances, provide customers with design solutions to fit their needs, gain a marketing inroad with customers with respect to our complete product line, and, in some cases, develop products that can be sold to additional customers in the future. Sales of advanced electronic components accounted for approximately 38% of Electronic Component segment net sales in fiscal 2019.
research and development
We place a high priority on solving customers’ electronic component design challenges and responding to their needs. In order to better serve our customers, we frequently designate teams consisting of marketing, field application engineering, research and development, and manufacturing personnel to work with customers to design and manufacture products to suit their specific requirements. We expense costs related to these activities as incurred.
research and development
Our emphasis on research and development is evidenced by the fact that most of our manufactured products and manufacturing processes have been designed and developed by our own engineers and scientists. Our research and development activities are carried out at facilities located in Czechia, France, Germany, India, Israel, Japan, Malaysia, South Korea, the United Kingdom and the United States, although a certain level of innovation occurs at all of our manufacturing sites.
research and development
Our research and development effort and our operational-level engineering effort place a priority on the design and development of product extensions, innovative new products, and improved manufacturing processes as well as engineering advances in existing product lines and manufacturing operations. Other areas of emphasis include material synthesis and the integration of components for applications requiring reduced size and lower manufacturing costs associated with circuit board assembly. Research, development, and engineering expenditures were approximately $31 million, $42 million, and $60 million during fiscal 2017, 2018, and 2019, respectively. The 2018 and 2019 expenditures include the impact of the three businesses acquired during those years. The level of such spending can fluctuate as new products are transferred to full-scale production and process enhancements are implemented.
research and development
In addition to our own research and development initiatives, we may invest in technology start-up enterprises, in which we may acquire a controlling or non-controlling interest but whose technology would be available to be commercialized by us. There are numerous risks in investments of this nature, including the limited operating history of such start-up entities, their need for capital, their limited or absence of production experience, as well as the risk that their technologies may prove ineffective or fail to gain acceptance in the marketplace. There can be no assurance that our current and future investments in start-up enterprises will prove successful.

We developed numerous new products and product extensions during fiscal 2012 and won several awards that recognize our technology leadership. These new products add to the broad product line we offer to our customers. Due to our broad product offering, none of our products individually represent a material portion of our revenues. Our scientists are working to develop product solutions to the challenges facing our customers as consumers and business demand more advanced electronic solutions to manage their everyday lives and businesses. Our engineers are continually working to enhance our manufacturing processes to improve capability, capacity and yield, while continuing to reduce manufacturing costs.
research and development
We also offer a line of advanced passive component products to fill the special needs of our customers. Our family of passive components also includes film capacitors, high energy/voltage power capacitors and varistors.

The manufacture of custom products permits us, through our research and development activities, to make technological advances, provide customers with design solutions to fit their needs, gain a marketing inroad with the customer with respect to our complete product line, and, in some cases, develop products that can be sold to additional customers in the future. Sales of advanced products accounted for approximately 40% of passive component net sales in fiscal 2012.
research and development
We place a high priority on solving customers' electronic component design challenges and responding to their needs. To better serve our customers we frequently designate teams consisting of marketing, research and development and manufacturing personnel to work with customers to design and manufacture products to suit their specific requirements. Costs related to these activities are expensed as incurred.
research and development
Our emphasis on research and development is evidenced by the fact that most of our manufactured products and manufacturing processes have been designed and developed by our own engineers and scientists. We coordinate our research and development activities from our facility at Headquarters with staff at other facilities located in the United States, United Kingdom, Czech Republic, Israel and France.
research and development
Our research and development effort and also operational level engineering effort place a priority on the design and development of innovative products and manufacturing processes and engineering advances in existing product lines and manufacturing operations. Other areas of emphasis include material synthesis and the integration of passive components for applications requiring reduced size and lower manufacturing costs associated with board assembly. Research, development and engineering expenditures were approximately $25 million, $24 million and $26 million during fiscal 2010, 2011 and 2012, respectively. The level of such spending can fluctuate as new products are transferred to full scale production and process enhancements are implemented.

In January 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Interpretation No. 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities" ("FIN 46"). Variable interest entities often are created for a single specified purpose, for example, to facilitate securitization, leasing, hedging, research and development, or other transactions or arrangements. Formerly "Consolidation of Certain Special Purpose Entities" in its draft form, this interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51, "Consolidated Financial Statements", defines what these variable interest entities are and provides guidelines on how to identify them and also on how an enterprise should assess its interests in a variable interest entity to decide whether to consolidate that entity. Generally, FIN 46 applies to variable interest entities created after January 31, 2003, and to variable interest entities in which an enterprise obtains an interest after that date. For existing variable interest entities in which an enterprise holds a variable interest that it acquired before February 1, 2003, the provisions of this interpretation will apply no later than the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period beginning after June 15, 2003. In December 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued a revised FIN 46 ("FIN 46-R") to address certain FIN 46 implementation issues. The effective dates and impact of FIN 46 and FIN 46-R are as follows: (i) for special-purpose entities ("SPEs") created prior to February 1, 2003, we must apply either the provisions of FIN 46 or early adopt the provisions of FIN 46-R at the end of the first interim or annual reporting period ending after December 15, 2003; (ii) for non-SPEs created prior to February 1, 2003, we are required to adopt FIN 46-R at the end of the first interim or annual reporting period ending after March 15, 2004; and (iii) for all entities, regardless of whether an SPE, that were created subsequent to January 31, 2003, the provisions of FIN 46 were applicable for variable interests in entities obtained after January 31, 2003. We did not have any variable interest entities during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2004. Accordingly, the adoption of FIN 46 and FIN 46-R did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.

The effective dates and impact of FIN 46 and FIN 46-R are as follows: (i) for special-purpose entities ("SPEs") created prior to February 1, 2003, the Company must apply either the provisions of FIN 46 or early adopt the provisions of FIN 46-R at the end of the first interim or annual reporting period ending after December 15, 2003; (ii) for non-SPEs created prior to February 1, 2003, the Company is required to adopt FIN 46-R at the end of the first interim or annual reporting period ending after March 15, 2004; and (iii) for all entities, regardless of whether an SPE, that were created subsequent to January 31, 2003, the provisions of FIN 46 were applicable for variable interests in entities obtained after January 31, 2003. We did not have any variable interest entities during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2004. Accordingly, the adoption of FIN 46 and FIN 46-R did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.

The Company's operating segments are based on the types of products from which the Company generates revenues. The Company has two operating segments: Passive Components and Connectors. The Passive Components segment consists primarily of surface mount and leaded ceramic and tantalum capacitors, film and power capacitors and varistors. Sales and operating results from these business units are shown in the table below and the operating results for passive components for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2004 include a $87,720 materials charge recorded during the quarter ended September 30, 2003. The operating results for passive components for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2002 include a $22,410 materials charge recorded during the quarter ended September 30, 2001. See Note 4 for a discussion of both materials charges. The Connectors segment consists primarily of Elco automotive, telecom and memory connectors. The various components of each of these respective segments are aggregated as they each have similar economic characteristics, products and services, production processes, customer classes and distribution channels. In addition, the Company has a corporate administration group consisting of finance and administrative activities and a separate Research and Development group.

On April 2, 2004, the Company completed its acquisition of certain sales and marketing subsidiaries from Kinseki Ltd. of Japan ("KSS"), a wholly owned subsidiary of our majority stockholder, Kyocera Corporation. Effective April 1, 2004, the Company has reorganized into a product line organization with five main product groups: Ceramic, Tantalum, Advanced, Connector and Kyocera Electronic Devices ("KED"). The KED division will contain the new KSS product group, along with Kyocera Developed Products ("KDP") group that is currently reported in the passive group segment and Kyocera Elco Connectors ("KEC") group that is currently reported in the connectors segment. Managers of each business unit will be responsible for the sales, marketing, production, research and development, and profitability of their division. The Company is evaluating the impact this reorganization will have on its segment reporting, and accordingly all segment reporting for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2005 will reflect the changes required under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards 131, "Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information" ("SFAS 131").

During fiscal 1998, we purchased a 41% interest in the research and development company, Electro-Chemical Research Ltd. ("ECR"). We made a further investment of $2,200 in May 2000 for an additional 10% interest in ECR. ECR has developed and patented a technology for high capacity electrical storage devices. We are committed to purchase the remaining interest in ECR. The purchase price for our interest in excess of 51% is determined based on sales and profitability of the products developed by ECR. The purchase price is not expected to have a material impact on our liquidity. We currently own 69% of ECR's outstanding shares.

We offer an extensive line of passive components designed to provide our customers with "one-stop shopping" for substantially all of their passive component needs. Passive components represented approximately 91% of our net sales in fiscal 2003, and connectors accounted for approximately 9% of our net sales in fiscal 2003. Financial information concerning our passive components, connectors and research and development segments is set forth in note 15 to the consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this Form 10-K.

We also offer a line of advanced passive component products to fill the special needs of our customers. Our advanced products engineers work with some customers' in-house technical staffs to design, produce and manufacture special products to meet the specifications of particular applications. The manufacture of special products permits us, through our research and development activities, to make technological advances, provide customers with design solutions to fit their needs, gain a marketing inroad with the customer with respect to our complete product line and, in some cases, develop products that can be sold to additional customers in the future. Our advanced products division presently has significant ongoing projects with a variety of key customers. Sales of advanced products accounted for approximately 24% of passive component net sales in fiscal 2003.

We place a high priority on solving customers' electronic component problems and responding to their needs. We frequently form teams consisting of marketing, research and development and manufacturing personnel to work with customers to design and manufacture products to suit their specific requirements.

Our emphasis on research and development is reflected by the fact that most of our manufactured products and manufacturing processes have been designed and developed by our own engineers and scientists. Our 60,000 square-foot facility in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina USA is dedicated entirely to pure research and development and provides centralized coordination of our global research and development efforts. We also maintain significant research and development staffs at our facilities in Northern Ireland, England, Israel and France.

Virtually all manufacturing, research and development and warehousing facilities could at any time be involved in the manufacturing, sale or distribution of passive components (PC) and connector products (CP). The following is a list of our facilities, their square footage, whether they are leased or owned and a description of their use.

Selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended March 31, 2002 were $103.7 million (8.3% of net sales), compared with $149.3 million (5.7% of net sales) for the year ended March 31, 2001. The decline in selling, general and administrative expenses, in absolute terms, is primarily due to lower sales commissions to independent manufacturers' representatives ($19.6 million), the reduction in administrative staff headcount and operating expenses ($16.5 million), and lower research and development costs ($4.5 million). The expenses for the year ended March 31, 2002 include a $3.0 million special charge for doubtful customers' receivables. The economic environment led to the receivables due from a few smaller customers to be significantly past due and determined to be uncollectable.

In January 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Interpretation No. 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities" ("FIN 46"). Variable interest entities often are created for a single specified purpose, for example, to facilitate securitization, leasing, hedging, research and development, or other transactions or arrangements. Formerly "Consolidation of Certain Special Purpose Entities" in its draft form, this interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51, "Consolidated Financial Statements", defines what these variable interest entities are and provides guidelines on how to identify them and also on how an enterprise should assess its interests in a variable interest entity to decide whether to consolidate that entity. Generally, FIN 46 applies to variable interest entities created after January 31, 2003, and to variable interest entities in which an enterprise obtains an interest after that date. For existing variable interest entities in which an enterprise holds a variable interest that it acquired before February 1, 2003, the provision of this interpretation will apply no later than the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period beginning after June 15, 2003. Currently, we do not have any variable interest entities and do not expect the adoption of FIN 46 to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.

In December 2014, the ACC voted that it had no objection to APS implementing an APS-owned rooftop solar research and development program aimed at learning how to efficiently enable the integration of rooftop solar and battery storage with the grid. The first stage of the program, called the "Solar Partner Program," placed 8 MW of residential rooftop solar on strategically selected distribution feeders in an effort to maximize potential system benefits, as well as made systems available to limited-income customers who could not easily install solar through transactions with third parties. The second stage of the program, which included an additional 2 MW of rooftop solar and energy storage, placed two energy storage systems sized at 2 MW on two different high solar penetration feeders to test various grid-related operation improvements and system interoperability, and was in operation by the end of 2016. The costs for this program have been included in APS's rate base as part of the 2017 Rate Case Decision.

On December 18, 2014, the NRC issued Volume 4 of the safety evaluation report developed as part of the Yucca Mountain construction authorization application. This volume covers administrative and programmatic requirements for the repository. It documents the staff’s evaluation of whether the DOE’s research and development and performance confirmation programs, as well as other administrative controls and systems, meet applicable NRC requirements. Volume 4 contains the staff’s finding that most administrative and programmatic requirements in NRC regulations are met, except for certain requirements relating to ownership of land and water rights.

Research and development activities are ongoing to develop and commercialize alternative technologies that produce power or reduce power consumption or emissions, including renewable technologies including photovoltaic (solar) cells, customer-sited generation, energy storage (batteries), and efficiency technologies. Advances in these, or other technologies could reduce the cost of power production, making APS’s existing generating facilities less economical. In addition, advances in technology and equipment/appliance efficiency could reduce the demand for power supply, which could adversely affect APS’s business.

In 2009, the DOE announced an ARRA commitment to fund the majority of a carbon dioxide emission reduction research and development project in the amount of $71 million, which was to be located at our Cholla power plant. Due to the increased resource and funding requirements for a project of that size, APS elected not to move forward with that award and is now in the process of closing out the project. However, APS is moving forward with work under the $3 million award from DOE for a high penetration photovoltaic generation study related to the Community Power Project in Flagstaff, Arizona. The funding under this DOE award will continue to be contingent upon meeting certain project milestones, including DOE-established budget parameters, over the next four years.

We determined fair value for our real estate assets primarily based on the future cash flows that we estimated would be generated by each asset discounted for market risk. Our impairment assessments and fair value determinations required significant judgment regarding key assumptions such as future sales prices, future construction and land development costs, future sales timing, and discount rates. The assumptions were specific to each project and may have varied among projects. The discount rates we used to determine fair values at December 31, 2009 ranged from 11% to 29%. Due to the judgment and assumptions applied in the estimation process, with regard to impairments, it is possible that actual results could have differed from those estimates.

During 2008, particularly late in the year, the real estate market weakened significantly resulting from the severe liquidity shortages in the financial markets, oversupply of home inventories, tight credit markets and downward pressure on residential and commercial property values. The effects of these factors have resulted in elevated cancellation rates, low sales absorption rates and overall weak consumer confidence. In recent months, the overall economy has weakened significantly and fears of a prolonged recession are now pronounced due to rising unemployment levels, further deterioration in consumer confidence and reduced consumer spending. Also, because of terms of renewal of SunCors Secured Revolver (see Note 6), during the fourth quarter of 2008, we revised forecasts related to potential disposal of certain assets classified as home inventory and as held and used. These factors resulted in 2008 impairment charges of $24 million related to our home inventory, which is considered held for sale and $29 million related to our held and used assets. The held and used assets include a project under development, an office building, a golf course, and completed home lots in Arizona. We determine fair value for our real estate assets primarily based on the future cash flows that we estimate will be generated by each asset discounted for market risk. Our impairment assessments and fair value determinations require significant judgment regarding key assumptions such as future sales prices, future construction and land development costs, future sales timing, and discount rates.

research and development
Abbott's research and development efforts may not succeed in developing commercially successful products and technologies, which may cause Abbott's revenue and profitability to decline.
research and development
To remain competitive, Abbott must continue to launch new products and technologies. To accomplish this, Abbott commits substantial efforts, funds, and other resources to research and development. A risk of failure is inherent in the research and development of new products and technologies. Abbott must make ongoing substantial expenditures without any assurance that its efforts will be commercially successful. Failure can occur at any point in the process, including after significant funds have been invested.
research and development
Abbott's research and development facilities in the United States are primarily located in California, Illinois, Minnesota, New Jersey, and Ohio. Abbott also has research and development facilities in various other countries, including China, Colombia, India, Singapore, Spain, and the United Kingdom.

 Abbott has acquired and continues to acquire significant intangible assets that Abbott records at fair value at the acquisition date. Transactions involving the purchase or sale of intangible assets occur with some frequency between companies in the health care field and valuations are usually based on a discounted cash flow analysis. The discounted cash flow model requires assumptions about the timing and amount of future net cash flows, risk, cost of capital, terminal values and market participants. Each of these factors can significantly affect the value of the intangible asset. Abbott engages independent valuation experts who review Abbott's critical assumptions and calculations for acquisitions of significant intangibles. Abbott reviews definite-lived intangible assets for impairment each quarter using an undiscounted net cash flows approach. If the undiscounted cash flows of an intangible asset are less than the carrying value of an intangible asset, the intangible asset is written down to its fair value, which is usually the discounted cash flow amount. Where cash flows cannot be identified for an individual asset, the review is applied at the lowest group level for which cash flows are identifiable. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, which relate to in-process research and development acquired in a business combination, are reviewed for impairment annually or when an event that could result in impairment occurs. At December 31, 2018, goodwill amounted to $23.3 billion and net intangibles amounted to $18.9 billion. Amortization expense in continuing operations for intangible assets amounted to $2.2 billion in 2018, $2.0 billion in 2017 and $550 million in 2016. There was no significant reduction of goodwill relating to impairments in 2018, 2017 and 2016.
research and development
Research and development expense was $2.3 billion in 2018, $2.3 billion in 2017, and $1.4 billion in 2016 and represented a 1.7 percent increase in 2018, and a 56.2 percent increase in 2017. The 2018 increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to higher spending on various projects, partially offset by lower restructuring and integration costs. The 2017 increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to the acquisition of the St. Jude Medical business. In 2018, research and development expenditures totaled $1.0 billion for the Cardiovascular and Neuromodulation Products
research and development
In 2017 and 2018, Abbott management approved restructuring plans as part of the integration of the acquisition of St. Jude Medical into the Cardiovascular and Neuromodulation Products segment and Alere into the Diagnostic Products segment, in order to leverage economies of scale and reduce costs. Abbott recorded charges, including one-time employee termination benefits, of approximately $52 million in 2018 and $187 million in 2017. Approximately $5 million in 2018 and 2017 are recorded in Cost of products sold, approximately $10 million in 2018 is recorded in Research and development and approximately $37 million in 2018 and $182 million in 2017 in Selling, general and administrative expense.

From 2016 to 2018, Abbott management approved plans to streamline operations in order to reduce costs and improve efficiencies in various Abbott businesses including the nutritional, established pharmaceuticals and vascular businesses. Abbott recorded employee-related severance and other charges of approximately $28 million in 2018, $120 million in 2017 and $32 million in 2016. Approximately $10 million in 2018, $7 million in 2017 and $9 million in 2016 are recorded in Cost of products sold, approximately $2 million in 2018, $77 million in 2017 and $5 million in 2016 are recorded in Research and development and approximately $16 million in 2018, $36 million in 2017 and $18 million in 2016 are recorded in Selling, general and administrative expense. Additional charges of approximately $2 million in 2017 and 2016 were recorded primarily for accelerated depreciation.

Research and Development Process
research and development
In the Diagnostics segment, the phases of the research and development process include:
research and development
In the Cardiovascular and Neuromodulation segment, the research and development process begins with research on a specific technology that is evaluated for feasibility and commercial viability. If the research program passes that hurdle, it moves forward into development. The development process includes evaluation, selection and qualification of a product design, completion of applicable clinical trials to test the product's safety and efficacy, and validation of the manufacturing process to demonstrate its repeatability and ability to consistently meet pre-determined specifications.
research and development
In the Nutritional segment, the research and development process generally focuses on identifying and developing ingredients and products that address the nutritional needs of particular populations (e.g., infants and adults) or patients (e.g., people with diabetes). Depending upon the country and/or region, if claims regarding a product's efficacy will be made, clinical studies typically must be conducted.
research and development
Cardiovascular and Neuromodulation  Abbott's research and development programs focus on:
research and development
Rapid Diagnostics  Abbott's research and development programs focus on the development of diagnostic products for cardiometabolic disease, infectious disease and toxicology.
research and development
Nutritionals  Abbott is focusing its research and development spend on platforms that span the pediatric and adult nutrition areas: gastro intestinal/immunity health, brain health, mobility and metabolism, and user experience platforms. Numerous new products that build on advances in these platforms are currently under development, including clinical outcome testing, and are expected to be launched over the coming years.
research and development
Given the diversity of Abbott's business, its intention to remain a broad-based healthcare company and the numerous sources for potential future growth, no individual project is expected to be material to cash flows or results of operations over the next five years. Factors considered included research and development expenses projected to be incurred for the project over the next year relative to Abbott's total research and development expenses, as well as qualitative factors, such as marketplace perceptions and impact of a new product on Abbott's overall market position. There were no delays in Abbott's 2018 research and development activities that are expected to have a material impact on operations.
research and development
While the aggregate cost to complete the numerous projects currently in development is expected to be material, the total cost to complete will depend upon Abbott's ability to successfully finish each project, the rate at which each project advances, and the ultimate timing for completion. Given the potential for significant delays and the risk of failure inherent in the development of medical device, diagnostic and pharmaceutical products and technologies, it is not possible to accurately estimate the total cost to complete all projects currently in development. Abbott plans to manage its portfolio of projects to achieve research and development spending that will be competitive in each of the businesses in which it participates, and such spending is expected to approximate 7.5 percent of total Abbott sales in 2019. Abbott does not regularly accumulate or make management decisions based on the total expenses incurred for a particular development phase in a given period.
research and development
Capital expenditures of $1.4 billion in 2018, $1.1 billion in 2017 and $1.1 billion in 2016 were principally for upgrading and expanding manufacturing and research and development facilities and equipment in various segments, investments in information technology, and laboratory instruments placed with customers.

IPR&D unless the project has an alternative future use. These costs include initial payments incurred prior to regulatory approval in connection with research and development collaboration agreements that provide rights to develop, manufacture, market and/or sell pharmaceutical products. The fair value of IPR&D projects acquired in a business combination are capitalized and accounted for as indefinite-lived intangible assets until completed and are then amortized over the remaining useful life. Collaborations are not significant.
research and development
Indefinite-lived intangible assets, which relate to in-process research and development acquired in a business combination, were approximately $3.6 billion and $3.9 billion at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The decrease in indefinite-lived intangible assets in 2018 primarily relates to purchase price allocation adjustments associated with the Alere acquisition. In 2017, in-process research and development increased by $4.5 billion due to the completion of the St. Jude Medical and Alere acquisitions, a portion of which became amortizable during the year. In 2017, Abbott also recorded a $53 million impairment of an

in-process research and development project related to the Cardiovascular and Neuromodulation Products segment.
research and development
In 2017 and 2018, Abbott management approved restructuring plans as part of the integration of the acquisitions of St. Jude Medical into the Cardiovascular and Neuromodulation Products segment, and Alere into the Diagnostic Products segment, in order to leverage economies of scale and reduce costs. Abbott recorded employee related severance and other charges of approximately $52 million in 2018 and $187 million in 2017. Approximately $5 million in 2018 and 2017 is recorded in Cost of products sold, approximately $10 million in 2018 is recorded in Research and development, and approximately $37 million in 2018 and $182 million in 2017 are recorded in Selling, general and administrative expense. Abbott also assumed restructuring liabilities of approximately $23 million as part of the St Jude Medical and Alere acquisitions. The following summarizes the activity related to these actions and the status of the related accruals:

Abbott's research and development efforts may not succeed in developing commercially successful products and technologies, which may cause Abbott's revenue and profitability to decline.
research and development
To remain competitive, Abbott must continue to launch new products and technologies. To accomplish this, Abbott commits substantial efforts, funds, and other resources to research and development. A risk of failure is inherent in the research and development of new products and technologies. Abbott must make ongoing substantial expenditures without any assurance that its efforts will be commercially successful. Failure can occur at any point in the process, including after significant funds have been invested.
research and development
Abbott's research and development facilities in the United States are primarily located in California, Illinois, Minnesota, New Jersey, and Ohio. Abbott also has research and development facilities in various other countries including China, Colombia, India, Singapore, Spain, and the United Kingdom.
research and development
 Abbott has acquired and continues to acquire significant intangible assets that Abbott records at fair value at the acquisition date. Transactions involving the purchase or sale of intangible assets occur with some frequency between companies in the health care field and valuations are usually based on a discounted cash flow analysis. The discounted cash flow model requires assumptions about the timing and amount of future net cash flows, risk, cost of capital, terminal values and market participants. Each of these factors can significantly affect the value of the intangible asset. Abbott engages independent valuation experts who review Abbott's critical assumptions and calculations for acquisitions of significant intangibles. Abbott reviews definite-lived intangible assets for impairment each quarter using an undiscounted net cash flows approach. If the undiscounted cash flows of an intangible asset are less than the carrying value of an intangible asset, the intangible asset is written down to its fair value, which is usually the discounted cash flow amount. Where cash flows cannot be identified for an individual asset, the review is applied at the lowest group level for which cash flows are identifiable. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, which relate to in-process research and development acquired in a business combination, are reviewed for impairment annually or when an event that could result in impairment occurs. At December 31, 2017, goodwill amounted to $24.0 billion and intangibles amounted to $21.5 billion. Amortization expense in continuing operations for intangible assets amounted to $2.0 billion in 2017, $550 million in 2016 and $601 million in 2015. There was no significant reduction of goodwill relating to impairments in 2017, 2016 and 2015.
research and development
Research and development expense was $2.235 billion in 2017, $1.422 billion in 2016, and $1.405 billion in 2015 and represented a 57.2 percent increase in 2017, and a 1.2 percent increase in 2016. The 2017 increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to the acquisition of the St. Jude Medical business. The 2016 increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to higher spending on various projects and the impairment of an in-process research and development asset related to a non-reportable segment, partially offset by lower restructuring costs in 2016. In 2017, research and development expenditures totaled $526 million for the Diagnostics Products segment, $967 million for the Cardiovascular and Neuromodulation Products segment, $195 million for the Nutritional Products segment, and $164 million for the Established Pharmaceutical Products segment.

acquisition resulted in non-deductible acquired in-process research and development of approximately $220 million, which is accounted for as an indefinite-lived intangible asset until regulatory approval or discontinuation, non-deductible goodwill of approximately $142 million, deferred tax assets and other net assets of approximately $18 million, deferred tax liabilities of approximately $85 million, and contingent consideration of approximately $70 million. The goodwill is identifiable to the Cardiovascular and Neuromodulation Products segment. If the acquisition of Tendyne had taken place as of the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period, consolidated net sales and earnings would not have been significantly different from reported amounts.

Approximately $7 million in 2017, $9 million in 2016 and $18 million in 2015 are recorded in Cost of products sold, approximately $77 million in 2017, $5 million in 2016 and $34 million in 2015 are recorded in Research and development and approximately $36 million in 2017, $19 million in 2016 and $43 million in 2015 are recorded in Selling, general and administrative expense. Additional charges of approximately $2 million in 2017, $2 million in 2016 and $45 million in 2015 were recorded primarily for accelerated depreciation.
r&d
In 2016, taxes on earnings from continuing operations include the impact of a net tax benefit of approximately $225 million, primarily as a result of the resolution of various tax positions from prior years, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of non-deductible foreign exchange losses related to Venezuela and the adjustment of the Mylan N.V. equity investment, as well as the recognition of deferred taxes associated with the then pending sale of AMO. In 2015, taxes on earnings from continuing operations include $71 million of tax expense related to gain on the disposal of shares of Mylan N.V. stock. The 2015 effective tax rate includes the impact of the R&D tax credit that was made permanent in the U.S. by the Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015.

These costs include initial payments incurred prior to regulatory approval in connection with research and development collaboration agreements that provide rights to develop, manufacture, market and/or sell pharmaceutical products. The fair value of IPR&D projects acquired in a business combination are capitalized and accounted for as indefinite-lived intangible assets until completed and are then amortized over the remaining useful life. Collaborations are not significant.

Abbott's research and development efforts may not succeed in developing commercially successful products and technologies, which may cause Abbott's revenue and profitability to decline.
research and development
To remain competitive, Abbott must continue to launch new products and technologies. To accomplish this, Abbott commits substantial efforts, funds, and other resources to research and development. A high rate of failure is inherent in the research and development of new products and technologies. Abbott must make ongoing substantial expenditures without any assurance that its efforts will be commercially successful. Failure can occur at any point in the process, including after significant funds have been invested.

valuation experts who review Abbott's critical assumptions and calculations for acquisitions of significant intangibles. Abbott reviews definite-lived intangible assets for impairment each quarter using an undiscounted net cash flows approach. If the undiscounted cash flows of an intangible asset are less than the carrying value of an intangible asset, the intangible asset is written down to its fair value, which is usually the discounted cash flow amount. Where cash flows cannot be identified for an individual asset, the review is applied at the lowest group level for which cash flows are identifiable. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, which relate to in-process research and development acquired in a business combination, are reviewed for impairment annually or when an event that could result in impairment occurs. At December 31, 2015, goodwill amounted to $9.6 billion and intangibles amounted to $5.6 billion, and amortization expense in continuing operations for intangible assets amounted to $601 million in 2015, $555 million in 2014 and $588 million in 2013. There were no impairments of goodwill in 2015, 2014 or 2013.

Research and Development Process
research and development
In the Diagnostics segment, the phases of the research and development process include:
research and development
In the Vascular segment, the research and development process begins with research on a specific technology that is evaluated for feasibility and commercial viability. If the research program passes that hurdle, it moves forward into development. The development process includes evaluation and selection of a product design, completion of clinical trials to test the product's safety and efficacy, and validation of the manufacturing process to demonstrate its repeatability and ability to consistently meet pre-determined specifications.
research and development
In the Nutritional segment, the research and development process generally focuses on identifying and developing ingredients and products that address the nutritional needs of particular populations (e.g., infants, athletes) or patients (e.g., people with diabetes). Depending upon the country and/or region, if claims regarding a product's efficacy will be made, clinical studies typically must be conducted.
research and development
Nutrition  Abbott is focusing its research and development spend on platforms that span the pediatric, adult and performance nutrition areas: gastro intestinal health, brain health, mobility and metabolism, and user experience platforms. Numerous new products that build on advances in these platforms are currently under development, including clinical outcome testing, and are expected to be launched over the coming years.
research and development
Given the diversity of Abbott's business, its intention to remain a broad-based healthcare company and the numerous sources for potential future growth, no individual project is expected to be material to cash flows or results of operations over the next five years. Factors considered included research and development expenses projected to be incurred for the project over the next year relative to Abbott's total research and development expenses as well as qualitative factors, such as marketplace perceptions and impact of a new product on Abbott's overall market position. There were no delays in Abbott's 2015 research and development activities that are expected to have a material impact on operations.
research and development
While the aggregate cost to complete the numerous projects currently in development is expected to be material, the total cost to complete will depend upon Abbott's ability to successfully complete each project, the rate at which each project advances, and the ultimate timing for completion. Given the potential for significant delays and the high rate of failure inherent in the development of pharmaceutical, medical device and diagnostic products and technologies, it is not possible to accurately estimate the total cost to complete all projects currently in development. Abbott plans to manage its portfolio of projects to achieve research and development spending equal to approximately 6 percent to 7 percent of sales each

Research and Development Process
research and development
In the Diagnostics segment, the phases of the research and development process include:
research and development
In the Vascular segment, the research and development process begins with research on a specific technology that is evaluated for feasibility and commercial viability. If the research program passes that hurdle, it moves forward into development. The development process includes evaluation and selection of a product design, completion of clinical trials to test the product's safety and efficacy, and validation of the manufacturing process to demonstrate its repeatability and ability to consistently meet pre-determined specifications.
research and development
In the Nutritional segment, the research and development process generally focuses on identifying and developing ingredients and products that address the nutritional needs of particular populations (e.g., infants, athletes) or patients (e.g., people with diabetes). Depending upon the country and/or region, if claims regarding a product's efficacy will be made, clinical studies typically must be conducted.
research and development
Nutrition  Abbott is focusing its research and development spend on six platforms that span the pediatric, adult and performance nutrition areas: immunity, cognition, lean body mass, inflammation, metabolism and tolerance. Numerous new products that build on advances in these platforms are currently under development, including clinical outcome testing, and are expected to be launched over the coming years.
research and development
Given the diversity of Abbott's business, its intention to remain a broad-based healthcare company and the numerous sources for potential future growth, no individual project is expected to be material to cash flows or results of operations over the next five years. Factors considered included research and development expenses projected to be incurred for the project over the next year relative to Abbott's total research and development expenses as well as qualitative factors, such as marketplace perceptions and impact of a new product on Abbott's overall market position. There were no delays in Abbott's 2014 research and development activities that are expected to have a material impact on operations.
research and development
While the aggregate cost to complete the numerous projects currently in development is expected to be material, the total cost to complete will depend upon Abbott's ability to successfully complete each project, the rate at which each project advances, and the ultimate timing for completion. Given the potential for significant delays and the high rate of failure inherent in the development of pharmaceutical, medical device and diagnostic products and technologies, it is not possible to accurately estimate the total cost to complete all projects currently in development. Abbott plans to manage its portfolio of projects to achieve research and development spending equal to approximately 6 percent to 7 percent of sales each year. Abbott does not regularly accumulate or make management decisions based on the total expenses incurred for a particular development phase in a given period.
research and development
Capital expenditures of $1.1 billion in 2014 and 2013 and $1.8 billion in 2012 were principally for upgrading and expanding manufacturing and research and development facilities and equipment in various segments, investments in information technology, and laboratory instruments placed with customers.

development cost
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS  Internal research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Clinical trial costs incurred by third parties are expensed as the contracted work is performed. Where contingent milestone payments are due to third parties under research and development arrangements, the milestone payment obligations are expensed when the milestone results are achieved.
r&d
ACQUIRED IN-PROCESS AND COLLABORATIONS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT (IPR&D)  The initial costs of rights to IPR&D projects obtained in an asset acquisition are expensed as IPR&D unless the project has an alternative future use. These costs include initial payments incurred prior to regulatory approval in connection with research and development collaboration agreements that provide rights to develop, manufacture, market and/or sell pharmaceutical products. The fair value of IPR&D projects acquired in a business combination are capitalized and accounted for as indefinite-lived intangible assets until completed and are then amortized over the remaining useful life. Collaborations are not significant for continuing operations.

In December 2014, Abbott completed the acquisition of Topera, Inc. for approximately $250 million in cash, plus additional payments up to $300 million to be made upon completion of certain regulatory and sales milestones. The acquisition of Topera provides Abbott a foundational entry in the electrophysiology market. The allocation of the fair value of the acquisition resulted in non-deductible acquired in-process research and development of approximately $20 million, which is accounted for as an indefinite-lived

In August 2013, Abbott acquired 100 percent of OptiMedica for $260 million, in cash, plus additional payments up to $150 million to be made upon completion of certain development, regulatory and sales milestones. The acquisition of OptiMedica provides Abbott with an immediate entry point into the laser assisted cataract surgery market. The final allocation of the fair value of the acquisition resulted in non-deductible definite-lived intangible assets of approximately $160 million; non-deductible acquired in-process research and development of approximately $60 million, which is accounted for as an indefinite-lived intangible asset until regulatory approval or discontinuation; non-deductible goodwill of approximately $130 million, net deferred tax liabilities of $49 million and contingent consideration of approximately $70 million. The fair value of the contingent consideration was determined based on an independent appraisal. Acquired intangible assets consist primarily of developed technology that is being amortized over 18 years.
research and development
The gross amount of amortizable intangible assets, primarily product rights and technology was $11.0 billion and $12.2 billion as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, and accumulated amortization was $4.9 billion and $6.8 billion as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Indefinite-lived intangible assets, which relate to in-process research and development acquired in a business combination, were approximately $134 million and $265 million at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. In 2014, the acquisition of CFR Pharmaceuticals increased intangible assets by approximately $1.8 billion. Approximately $804 million of net intangible assets related to the developed markets branded generics pharmaceuticals businesses was reclassified to Non-current assets held for disposition due to the planned disposition of this business. Gross amortizable intangible assets, accumulated amortization and indefinite-lived intangible assets of $5.7 billion, $3.8 billion and $417 million, respectively, were transferred to AbbVie as part of the separation on January 1, 2013. In 2012, Abbott recorded an impairment charge of $69 million for certain research and development assets due to changes in the projected development and regulatory timelines for the projects. The charges relate to non-reportable segments. Discounted cash flow analysis was used to analyze fair value and the charges are included in research and development expenses.
research and development
$48 million in 2012 are recognized in Cost of products sold, $6 million is recognized in Research and development in 2014, and approximately $112 million in 2014, $32 million in 2013 and $48 million in 2012 recognized as Selling, general and administrative expense. The remaining charges of $32 million in 2013 and $71 million in 2012 are related to Abbott's developed market established pharmaceutical business and are being recognized in the results of discontinued operations. Additional charges of approximately $4 million in 2013 and $22 million in 2012 were also recorded primarily for accelerated depreciation.
research and development
In 2013 and prior years, Abbott management approved plans to realign its worldwide pharmaceutical and vascular manufacturing operations and selected domestic and international commercial and research and development operations in order to reduce costs. In 2013, Abbott recorded employee severance charges of approximately $11 million. In 2011, Abbott recorded charges reflecting the impairment of manufacturing facilities and other assets, employee severance and other related charges. Approximately $11 million in 2013 is classified as Cost of products sold. An additional $41 million and $110 million were recorded in 2013 and 2012, respectively, relating to these restructurings, primarily for accelerated depreciation.

In 2012 and 2010, Abbott management approved restructuring plans primarily related to the acquisition of Solvay's pharmaceuticals business. These plans streamline operations, improve efficiencies and reduce costs in certain Solvay sites and functions as well as in certain Abbott and Solvay commercial organizations in various countries. In 2012, Abbott recorded a charge of approximately $150 million for employee severance and contractual obligations, primarily related to the exit from a research and development facility. These charges are related to businesses transferred to AbbVie and are being recognized in the results of discontinued operations. The accrued restructuring reserves of $115 million at

Abbott's research and development efforts may not succeed in developing commercially successful products and technologies, which may cause Abbott's revenue and profitability to decline.
research and development
To remain competitive, Abbott must continue to launch new products and technologies. To accomplish this, Abbott commits substantial efforts, funds, and other resources to research and development. A high rate of failure is inherent in the research and development of new products and technologies. Abbott must make ongoing substantial expenditures without any assurance that its efforts will be commercially successful. Failure can occur at any point in the process, including after significant funds have been invested.

Abbott's research and development facilities in the United States are primarily located in California, Illinois, New Jersey, and Ohio. Abbott also has research and development facilities in various other countries including China, India, Singapore, Spain, and Switzerland.
research and development
 Abbott has acquired and continues to acquire significant intangible assets that Abbott records at fair value. Transactions involving the purchase or sale of intangible assets occur with some frequency between companies in the health care field and valuations are usually based on a discounted cash flow analysis. The discounted cash flow model requires assumptions about the timing and amount of future net cash flows, risk, the cost of capital, terminal values and market participants. Each of these factors can significantly affect the value of the intangible asset. Abbott engages independent valuation experts who review Abbott's critical assumptions and calculations for acquisitions of significant intangibles. Abbott reviews definite-lived intangible assets for impairment each quarter using an undiscounted net cash flows approach. If the undiscounted cash flows of an intangible asset are less than the carrying value of an intangible asset, the intangible asset is written down to its fair value, which is usually the discounted cash flow amount. Where cash flows cannot be identified for an individual asset, the review is applied at the lowest group level for which cash flows are identifiable. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, which relate to in-process research and development acquired in a business combination, are reviewed for impairment annually or when an event that could result in an impairment occurs. At December 31, 2013, goodwill amounted to $9.8 billion and intangibles amounted to $5.7 billion, and amortization expense for intangible assets amounted to $791 million in 2013, $795 million in 2012 and $884 million in 2011. There were no impairments of goodwill in 2013, 2012 or 2011. In 2012 and 2011, Abbott recorded impairment charges of $69 million and $125 million, respectively, for certain research and development assets due to changes in the projected development and regulatory timelines for the projects.
research and development
Research and development expense was $1.452 billion in 2013, $1.544 billion in 2012 and $1.512 billion in 2011 and represented a 6.0 percent decrease in 2013, and a 2.1 percent increase in 2012. The 2013 decrease primarily reflects the incurrence of restructuring and asset impairment charges in 2012 which did not recur in 2013. In 2013, research and development expenditures totaled $336 million for the Vascular Products segment, $416 million for the Diagnostics Products segment, $239 million for the Established Pharmaceutical Products segment and $188 million for the Nutritional Products segment.

In August 2013, Abbott acquired 100 percent of IDEV Technologies, net of debt, for $310 million, in cash. The acquisition of IDEV Technologies expands Abbott's endovascular portfolio. The allocation of the fair value of the acquisition resulted in non-deductible acquired in-process research and development of approximately $170 million which is accounted for as an indefinite-lived intangible asset until regulatory approval or discontinuation, non-deductible definite-lived intangible assets of approximately $66 million, non-deductible goodwill of approximately $123 million and net deferred tax liabilities of $56 million. Acquired intangible assets consist of developed technology and are being amortized over 11 years.

Research and Development Process
research and development
In the Proprietary Pharmaceuticals segment, the research and development process generally begins with discovery research which focuses on the identification of a molecule that has a desired effect against a given disease. If preclinical testing of an identified compound proves successful, the compound moves into clinical development which generally includes the following phases:
research and development
The research and development process from discovery through a new drug launch typically takes 8 - 12 years and can be even longer. There is a significant amount of uncertainty inherent in the research and development of new pharmaceutical products and there is no guarantee when, or if, a molecule will receive the regulatory approval required to launch a new drug or indication.
research and development
In addition to the development of new products and new formulations, proprietary pharmaceutical research and development projects also may include Phase IV trials, sometimes called post-marketing studies. For such projects, clinical trials are designed and conducted to collect additional data regarding, among other parameters, the benefits and risks of an approved drug.
research and development
In the Diagnostics segment, the phases of the research and development process include:

In the Vascular segment, the research and development process begins with research on a specific technology that is evaluated for feasibility and commercial viability. If the research program passes that hurdle, it moves forward into development. The development process includes evaluation and selection of a product design, completion of clinical trials to test the product's safety and efficacy, and validation of the manufacturing process to demonstrate its repeatability and ability to consistently meet pre-determined specifications.

In February 2010, Abbott acquired Solvay's pharmaceuticals business (Solvay Pharmaceuticals) for approximately $6.1 billion, in cash, plus additional payments of up to EUR 100 million per year if certain sales milestones are met in 2011, 2012 and 2013. Contingent consideration of approximately $290 million was recorded. The acquisition of Solvay Pharmaceuticals provided Abbott with a large and complementary portfolio of pharmaceutical products and expands Abbott's presence in key global emerging markets. Abbott acquired control of this business on February 15, 2010 and the financial results of the acquired operations are included in these financial statements beginning on that date. Net sales for the acquired operations for 2010 were approximately $3.1 billion. Pretax loss of the acquired operations, including acquisition, integration and restructuring expenses, for 2010 was approximately $395 million. The acquisition was funded with cash and short-term investments. The allocation of the fair value of the acquisition resulted in the recording of $2.2 billion of non-deductible goodwill, $4.1 billion of non-deductible intangible assets, $500 million of non-deductible acquired in-process research and development assets, net tangible assets of $700 million and deferred income taxes of $1.1 billion. Acquired intangible assets consist primarily of product rights for currently marketed products and are amortized over 2 to 14 years (average of 11 years). Acquired in-process research and development projects are accounted for as indefinite lived intangible assets until regulatory approval or discontinuation. The net tangible assets acquired consist primarily of trade accounts receivable of approximately $675 million, inventory of approximately $390 million, property and equipment of approximately $725 million, net of assumed liabilities, primarily trade accounts payable, accrued compensation and other liabilities.

Abbott's Proprietary Pharmaceutical Products segment has entered into various collaboration research and development agreements. In 2012, Abbott acquired AP214, a drug under development for the prevention of acute kidney injury associated with major cardiac surgery in patients at increased risk, and as a result of this transaction, Abbott recorded a charge to acquired in-process and collaborations research and development of $110 million. In addition, in 2012, Abbott entered into a global collaboration to develop and commercialize an oral, next-generation JAK1 inhibitor in Phase II development with the potential to treat multiple autoimmune diseases, and as a result of this transaction Abbott recorded a charge to acquired in-process and collaborations research and development of $150 million. Additional payments of approximately $1.2 billion could be required for the achievement of certain development, regulatory and commercial milestones under this agreement. Under another collaboration, Abbott was granted the rights in 2012 to utilize up to three antibody-drug conjugate compounds and Abbott recorded a charge to acquired in-process and collaborations research and development of $28 million. Additional payments of approximately $220 million for each licensed compound could be required for the achievement of certain development, regulatory and commercial milestones under this agreement. In connection with the acquisition of Solvay Pharmaceuticals, the achievement of a certain sales milestone resulted in a payment of approximately $134 million in the first quarter of 2012 for which a liability was previously established.

Abbott's research and development efforts may not succeed in developing commercially successful products and technologies, which may cause Abbott's revenue and profitability to decline.
research and development
To remain competitive, Abbott must continue to launch new products and technologies. To accomplish this, Abbott commits substantial efforts, funds, and other resources to research and development. A high rate of failure is inherent in the research and development of new products and technologies. Abbott must make ongoing substantial expenditures without any assurance that its efforts will be commercially successful. Failure can occur at any point in the process, including after significant funds have been invested.
research and development
After the separation of AbbVie, Abbott's research and development facilities in the United States are primarily located in California, Illinois, New Jersey, and Ohio. Abbott also has research and development facilities in various other countries including Germany, Netherlands, Singapore, Spain, and the United Kingdom. Prior to the separation of AbbVie, research and development related to the Proprietary Pharmaceutical Products segment was carried out in various locations including California, Illinois and Massachusetts in the United States, Germany, and Japan.
research and development
Pharmaceutical research and development was focused over the last three years on therapeutic areas that included immunology, oncology, neuroscience, pain management, hepatitis C (HCV), chronic kidney disease and women's health. In addition, Abbott acquired the rights to various in-process pharmaceutical research and development projects including the development of second-generation oral antioxidant inflammation modulators and an oral, next-generation JAK1 inhibitor with the potential to treat multiple autoimmune diseases.
research and development
 Abbott has acquired and continues to acquire significant intangible assets that Abbott records at fair value. Transactions involving the purchase or sale of intangible assets occur with some frequency between companies in the health care field and valuations are usually based on a discounted cash flow analysis. The discounted cash flow model requires assumptions about the timing and amount of future net cash flows, risk, the cost of capital, terminal values and market participants. Each of these factors can significantly affect the value of the intangible asset. Abbott engages independent valuation experts who review Abbott's critical assumptions and calculations for acquisitions of significant intangibles. Abbott reviews definite-lived intangible assets for impairment each quarter using an undiscounted net cash flows approach. If the undiscounted cash flows of an intangible asset are less than the carrying value of an intangible asset, the intangible asset is written down to its fair value, which is usually the discounted cash flow amount. Where cash flows cannot be identified for an individual asset, the review is applied at the lowest group level for which cash flows are identifiable. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, which relate to in-process research and development acquired in a business combination, are reviewed for impairment annually or when an event that could result in an impairment occurs. At December 31, 2012, goodwill and intangibles amounted to $15.8 billion and $8.6 billion, respectively, and amortization expense for intangible assets amounted to $1.4 billion in 2012. There were no impairments of goodwill in 2012, 2011 or 2010. In 2012 and 2011, Abbott recorded impairment charges of $82 million and $174 million, respectively, for certain research and development assets due to changes in the projected development and regulatory timelines for the projects.
research and development
Research and development expense was $4.322 billion in 2012, $4.129 billion in 2011 and $3.724 billion in 2010 and represented increases of 4.7 percent in 2012, 10.9 percent in 2011 and 35.7 percent in 2010. Excluding charges related to the Solvay restructurings announced in September 2010, research and development expense increased 6.2 percent in 2011 and 29.4 percent in 2010. The 2010 increase, exclusive of the effects of the restructuring charges, reflects the acquisitions of Solvay's pharmaceuticals business in February 2010 and Facet Biotech in April 2010. The increases in 2012, 2011 and 2010 also reflect continued pipeline spending, including programs in biologics, hepatitis C and diagnostics. The majority of research and development expenditures over the three years were

In 2011 and prior years, Abbott management approved plans to realign its worldwide pharmaceutical and vascular manufacturing operations and selected domestic and international commercial and research and development operations in order to reduce costs. In 2011 and 2010, Abbott recorded charges of approximately $194 million and $56 million, respectively, reflecting the impairment of manufacturing facilities and other assets, employee severance and other related charges. Approximately $76 million in 2011 is classified as Cost of products sold, $69 million as Research and development and $49 million as Selling, general and administrative. Approximately $56 million in 2010 is classified as Cost of products sold. The following summarizes the activity for these restructurings:

In 2012 and 2010, Abbott management approved restructuring plans primarily related to the acquisition of Solvay's pharmaceuticals business. These plans streamline operations, improve efficiencies and reduce costs in certain Solvay sites and functions as well as in certain Abbott and Solvay commercial organizations in various countries. In 2012, Abbott recorded a charge of approximately $150 million for employee severance and contractual obligations, primarily related to the exit from a research and development facility. Approximately $142 million is recorded as Research and development and $8 million as Selling, general and administrative. In 2010, Abbott recorded charges to Cost of products sold, Research and development and Selling, general and administrative of approximately $99 million, $152 million and $272 million, respectively. The following summarizes the activity for these restructurings:

Research and Development Process
research and development
In the Proprietary Pharmaceuticals segment, the research and development process generally begins with discovery research which focuses on the identification of a molecule that has a desired effect against a given disease. If preclinical testing of an identified compound proves successful, the compound moves into clinical development which generally includes the following phases:
research and development
The research and development process from discovery through a new drug launch typically takes 8 - 12 years and can be even longer. There is a significant amount of uncertainty inherent in the research and development of new pharmaceutical products and there is no guarantee when, or if, a molecule will receive the regulatory approval required to launch a new drug or indication.
research and development
In addition to the development of new products and new formulations, proprietary pharmaceutical research and development projects also may include Phase IV trials, sometimes called post-marketing studies. For such projects, clinical trials are designed and conducted to collect additional data regarding, among other parameters, the benefits and risks of an approved drug.
research and development
In the Diagnostics segment, the phases of the research and development process include:
research and development
In the Vascular segment, the research and development process begins with research on a specific technology that is evaluated for feasibility and commercial viability. If the research program passes that hurdle, it moves forward into development. The development process includes evaluation and selection of a product design, completion of clinical trials to test the product's safety and efficacy, and validation of the manufacturing process to demonstrate its repeatability and ability to consistently meet pre-determined specifications.
research and development
In the Nutritional segment, the research and development process generally focuses on identifying and developing ingredients and products that address the nutritional needs of particular populations (e.g., infants, athletes) or patients (e.g., people with diabetes). Depending upon the country and/or region, if claims regarding a product's efficacy will be made, clinical studies typically must be conducted. Most other product development, such as a product form change from liquid to powder, generally does not necessitate clinical studies.
r&d
blood glucose monitoring system that includes a touch-screen interface and other features designed to support the insulin-using patient. After receiving CE Mark for this system in May 2011 and Health Canada approval in October 2011, Abbott is continuing to provide R&D support as the product is launched in additional markets. Development is also continuing on an updated hospital blood glucose monitoring system for which a filing for approval is projected to be submitted in the U.S. during the first half of 2013. Abbott is also developing a next-generation monitoring system under the Precision product platform and for which Abbott anticipates submitting filings for approval in various markets in the second half of 2013.
research and development
Nutrition  Abbott is focusing its research and development spend on six benefit platforms that span the pediatric, adult and performance nutrition areas: immunity, cognition, lean body mass, inflammation, metabolism and tolerance. Numerous new products that build on advances in these benefit platforms are currently under development and are expected to be launched over the coming years.
research and development
Given the diversity of Abbott's business, its intention to remain a broad-based healthcare company and the numerous sources for potential future growth, no individual project is expected to be material to cash flows or results of operations over the next five years. Factors considered included research and development expenses projected to be incurred for the project over the next year relative to Abbott's total research and development expenses as well as qualitative factors, such as marketplace perceptions and impact of a new product on Abbott's overall market position. There were no delays in Abbott's 2012 research and development activities that are expected to have a material impact on operations.
research and development
While the aggregate cost to complete the numerous projects currently in development is expected to be material, the total cost to complete will depend upon Abbott's ability to successfully complete each project, the rate at which each project advances, and the ultimate timing for completion. Given the potential for significant delays and the high rate of failure inherent in the research and development of new pharmaceutical and medical device products and technologies, it is not possible to accurately estimate the total cost to complete all projects currently in development. After the separation of AbbVie, Abbott plans to manage its portfolio of projects to achieve research and development spend equal to approximately 6 percent to 7 percent of sales each year. Abbott does not regularly accumulate or make management decisions based on the total expenses incurred for a particular development phase in a given period.

In February 2010, Abbott acquired Solvay's pharmaceuticals business (Solvay Pharmaceuticals) for approximately $6.1 billion, in cash, plus additional payments of up to EUR 100 million per year if certain sales milestones are met in 2011, 2012 and 2013. Contingent consideration of approximately $290 million was recorded. The acquisition of Solvay Pharmaceuticals provided Abbott with a large and complementary portfolio of pharmaceutical products and expands Abbott's presence in key global emerging markets. Abbott acquired control of this business on February 15, 2010 and the financial results of the acquired operations are included in these financial statements beginning on that date. Net sales for the acquired operations for 2010 were approximately $3.1 billion. Pretax loss of the acquired operations, including acquisition, integration and restructuring expenses, for 2010 was approximately $395 million. The acquisition was funded with cash and short-term investments. The allocation of the fair value of the acquisition resulted in the recording of $2.2 billion of non-deductible goodwill, $4.1 billion of non-deductible intangible assets, $500 million of non-deductible acquired in-process research and development assets, net tangible assets of $700 million and deferred income taxes of $1.1 billion. Acquired intangible assets consist primarily of product rights for currently marketed products and are amortized over 2 to 14 years (average of 11 years). Acquired in-process research and development projects are accounted for as indefinite lived intangible assets until regulatory approval or discontinuation. The net tangible assets acquired consist primarily of trade accounts receivable of approximately $675 million, inventory of approximately $390 million, property and equipment of approximately $725 million, net of assumed liabilities, primarily trade accounts payable, accrued compensation and other liabilities.

In March 2010, Abbott acquired STARLIMS Technologies for approximately $100 million, in cash, net of cash held by STARLIMS, providing Abbott with leading products and expertise to build its position in laboratory informatics. A substantial portion of the fair value of the acquisition has been allocated to goodwill and amortizable intangible assets. In April 2010, Abbott acquired the outstanding shares of Facet Biotech Corporation for approximately $430 million, in cash, net of cash held by Facet. The acquisition enhanced Abbott's early- and mid-stage pharmaceutical pipeline, including a biologic for multiple sclerosis and compounds that complement Abbott's oncology program. A substantial portion of the fair value of the acquisition was allocated to acquired in-process research and development that is accounted for as an indefinite-lived intangible asset until regulatory approval or discontinuation.

 Abbott has acquired and continues to acquire significant intangible assets that Abbott records at fair value. Transactions involving the purchase or sale of intangible assets occur with some frequency between companies in the health care field and valuations are usually based on a discounted cash flow analysis. The discounted cash flow model requires assumptions about the timing and amount of future net cash flows, risk, the cost of capital, terminal values and market participants. Each of these factors can significantly affect the value of the intangible asset. Abbott engages independent valuation experts who review Abbott's critical assumptions and calculations for acquisitions of significant intangibles. Abbott reviews definite-lived intangible assets for impairment each quarter using an undiscounted net cash flows approach. If the undiscounted cash flows of an intangible asset are less than the carrying value of an intangible asset, the intangible asset is written down to its fair value, which is usually the discounted cash flow amount. Where cash flows cannot be identified for an individual asset, the review is applied at the lowest group level for which cash flows are identifiable. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, which relate to in-process research and development acquired in a business combination, are reviewed for impairment annually or when an event that could result in an impairment occurs. At December 31, 2011, goodwill and intangibles amounted to $15.7 billion and $10.0 billion, respectively, and amortization expense for intangible assets amounted to $1.6 billion in 2011. There were no impairments of goodwill in 2011, 2010 or 2009. In 2011, Abbott recorded impairment charges of $174 million for certain research and development assets due to changes in the projected development and regulatory timelines for the projects.
research and development
Research and development expense was $4.129 billion in 2011, $3.724 billion in 2010 and $2.744 billion in 2009 and represented increases of 10.9 percent in 2011, 35.7 percent in 2010 and 2.0 percent in 2009. Excluding charges related to the Solvay restructurings announced in September 2010, research and development expense increased 29.4 percent in 2010 and 6.2 percent in 2011. The 2010 increase, exclusive of the effects of the restructuring charges, reflects the acquisitions of Solvay's pharmaceuticals business in February 2010 and Facet Biotech in April 2010. The increase in 2009 reflects the favorable effect of exchange rates which reduced research and development expense in 2009. Excluding
research and development
the effect of exchange, research and development expenses increased 3.4 percent in 2009. The increases in 2011, 2010 and 2009 also reflect continued pipeline spending, including programs in vascular devices, biologics, neuroscience, oncology and hepatitis C. The majority of research and development expenditures are concentrated on pharmaceutical products. $2.8 billion of Abbott's 2011 research and development expenses related to Abbott's pharmaceutical products, of which $2.2 billion was directly allocated to the Proprietary Pharmaceutical Products segment. In 2011, research and development expenditures totaled $403 million for the Vascular Products segment, $325 million for the Diagnostics Products segment, $251 million for the Established Pharmaceutical Products segment and $165 million for the Nutritional Products segment.

In 2011 and prior years, Abbott management approved plans to realign its worldwide pharmaceutical and vascular manufacturing operations and selected domestic and international commercial and research and development operations in order to reduce costs. In 2011, 2010 and 2009, Abbott recorded charges of approximately $194 million, $56 million and $114 million, respectively, reflecting the impairment of manufacturing facilities and other assets, employee severance and other related charges. Approximately $76 million in 2011 is classified as Cost of products sold, $69 million as Research and development and $49 million as Selling, general and administrative. Approximately $56 million in 2010 is classified as Cost of products sold and $114 million in 2009 as Selling, general and administrative. The following summarizes the activity for these restructurings:

In 2010, Abbott management approved a restructuring plan primarily related to the acquisition of Solvay's pharmaceuticals business. This plan streamlines operations, improves efficiencies and reduces costs in certain Solvay sites and functions as well as in certain Abbott and Solvay commercial organizations in various countries. Under this plan, Abbott recorded charges to Cost of products sold, Research and development and Selling, general and administrative of approximately $99 million, $152 million and $272 million, respectively. The following summarizes the activity for this restructuring:
research and development
Other (income) expense, net, for 2011 includes $56 million of fair value adjustments and accretion in the contingent consideration related to the acquisition of Solvay's pharmaceutical business. Other (income) expense, net, for 2009 includes the derecognition of a contingent liability of $797 million associated with the conclusion of the TAP Pharmaceutical Products Inc. joint venture. The contingent liability was established at the conclusion of the joint venture as Abbott agreed to remit cash to Takeda if certain research and development events were not achieved on the development assets retained by Takeda. In 2009, the research and development events were achieved and the contingent liability was derecognized. In addition, Other (income) expense, net for 2009 includes a $287 million gain from the settlement reached between Abbott and Medtronic, Inc. resolving all outstanding intellectual property litigation between the two parties and income from the recording of certain investments at fair value in connection with business acquisitions. Other (income) expense, net, for 2011, 2010 and 2009 also includes ongoing contractual payments from Takeda associated with the conclusion of the TAP joint venture.

Research and Development Process
research and development
In the Proprietary Pharmaceuticals segment, the research and development process generally begins with discovery research which focuses on the identification of a molecule that has a desired effect against a given disease. If preclinical testing of an identified compound proves successful, the compound moves into clinical development which generally includes the following phases:
research and development
The research and development process from discovery through a new drug launch typically takes 8 - 12 years and can be even longer. There is a significant amount of uncertainty inherent in the research and development of new pharmaceutical products and there is no guarantee when, or if, a molecule will receive the regulatory approval required to launch a new drug or indication.
research and development
In addition to the development of new products and new formulations, proprietary pharmaceutical research and development projects also may include Phase IV trials, sometimes called post-marketing studies. For such projects, clinical trials are designed and conducted to collect additional data regarding, among other parameters, the benefits and risks of an approved drug.
research and development
In the Established Pharmaceuticals segment, the research and development process focuses on the geographic expansion and continuous improvement of the segment's existing products to provide Improved Therapeutic Benefits (ITBs) to patients and customers. As Established Pharmaceuticals does not actively pursue primary research, development usually begins with work on existing products or after the acquisition of an advanced stage licensing opportunity.
research and development
In the Diagnostics segment, the phases of the research and development process include:
research and development
In the Vascular segment, the research and development process begins with research on a specific technology that is evaluated for feasibility and commercial viability. If the research program passes that hurdle, it moves forward into development. The development process includes evaluation and selection of a product design, completion of clinical trials to test the product's safety and efficacy, and validation of the manufacturing process to demonstrate its repeatability and ability to consistently meet pre-determined specifications.
research and development
In the Nutritional segment, the research and development process generally focuses on identifying and developing ingredients and products that address the nutritional needs of particular populations (e.g., infants, athletes) or patients (e.g., people with diabetes). Depending upon the country and/or region, if claims regarding a product's efficacy will be made, clinical studies typically must be conducted. Most

blood glucose monitoring system that includes new features designed to support the insulin-using patient for regulatory approval in the U.S. in June 2011. After receiving CE Mark for this system in May 2011 and Health Canada approval in October 2011, Abbott is continuing to provide R&D support as the product is launched in additional markets. Development is also continuing on an updated hospital blood glucose monitoring system for which filings for approval are projected to be submitted in the U.S. and Europe during the first half of 2013. Abbott is also developing a next-generation monitoring system under the Precision product platform. Abbott anticipates submitting filings for approval in various markets in 2013.
research and development
Nutrition  Abbott is focusing its research and development spend on six benefit platforms that span the pediatric, adult and performance nutrition areas: immunity, cognition, lean body mass, inflammation, metabolism and tolerance. Numerous new products that build on advances in these benefit platforms are currently under development and are expected to be launched in 2012.
research and development
Given the diversity of Abbott's business, its intention to remain a broad-based healthcare company and the numerous sources for potential future growth, no individual project is expected to be material to cash flows or results of operations over the next five years. Factors considered included research and development expenses projected to be incurred for the project (compound or device) over the next year relative to Abbott's total research and development expenses as well as qualitative factors, such as marketplace perceptions and impact of a new product on Abbott's overall market position. There were no delays in Abbott's 2011 research and development activities that are expected to have a material impact on operations.
research and development
While the aggregate cost to complete the numerous pharmaceutical and medical device projects currently in development is expected to be material, the total cost to complete will depend upon Abbott's ability to successfully complete each project, the rate at which each project advances, and the ultimate timing for completion. Given the potential for significant delays and the high rate of failure inherent in the research and development of new pharmaceutical and medical device products and technologies, it is not possible to accurately estimate the total cost to complete all projects currently in development. However, Abbott plans to continue to manage its portfolio of projects to achieve research and development spend equal to approximately 9.5 percent to 10 percent of sales each year. Abbott does not regularly accumulate or make management decisions based on the total expenses incurred for a particular development phase in a given period.
development cost
Additionally, products may be entitled to obtain other forms of legal or regulatory exclusivity upon approval. These forms of regulatory exclusivity have a variety of terms in the United States and are variable in other jurisdictions. In the United States, when the FDA approves a new chemical entity that it has not previously approved alone or in combination with other chemical entities, the product is granted 5 years of regulatory exclusivity. The FDA may grant 3 years of market exclusivity for an NDA, including supplementary applications, if the application contains reports of new clinical investigations that have not previously been relied upon by the FDA. If the FDA grants pediatric exclusivity, the longest existing exclusivity (patent or regulatory) related to the product would be extended by 6 months. If the FDA designates a product as an orphan drug that is either used to treat conditions that afflict a relatively small population or for which there is not a reasonable expectation that the research and development costs will be recovered, the FDA may grant 7 years of exclusivity.

To remain competitive, Abbott must continue to launch new products and technologies. To accomplish this, Abbott commits substantial efforts, funds, and other resources to research and development. A high rate of failure is inherent in the research and development of new products and technologies. Abbott must make ongoing substantial expenditures without any assurance that its efforts will be commercially successful. Failure can occur at any point in the process, including after significant funds have been invested.

 Abbott has acquired and continues to acquire significant intangible assets that Abbott records at fair value. Transactions involving the purchase or sale of intangible assets occur with some frequency between companies in the health care field and valuations are usually based on a discounted cash flow analysis. The discounted cash flow model requires assumptions about the timing and amount of future net cash flows, risk, the cost of capital, terminal values and market participants. Each of these factors can significantly affect the value of the intangible asset. Abbott engages independent valuation experts who review Abbott's critical assumptions and calculations for acquisitions of significant intangibles.

Research and development expense was $3.724 billion in 2010, $2.744 billion in 2009 and $2.689 billion in 2008 and represented increases of 35.7 percent in 2010, 2.0 percent in 2009 and 7.3 percent in 2008. Excluding charges related to the Solvay restructurings announced in September 2010, research and development expenses in 2010 increased 29.4 percent. This increase, exclusive of the effects of the restructuring charges, reflects the acquisitions of Solvay's pharmaceuticals business in February 2010 and Facet Biotech in April 2010. The increase in 2009 reflects the favorable effect of exchange rates which reduced research and development expense in 2009. Excluding the effect of exchange, research and development expenses increased 3.4 percent in 2009. The increases in 2010, 2009 and 2008 also reflect continued pipeline spending, including programs in vascular devices, biologics, neuroscience, oncology and hepatitis C. The majority of research and development expenditures are concentrated on pharmaceutical products.

product rights, of approximately $700 million, goodwill of approximately $350 million and deferred tax liabilities related primarily to the intangible assets of approximately $260 million. The intangible assets are being amortized over 15 years. Abbott agreed to remit cash to Takeda if certain research and development events were not achieved on the development assets retained by Takeda. These amounts were recorded as a liability at closing in the amount of approximately $1.1 billion. Related deferred tax assets of approximately $410 million were also recorded. Of the $1.1 billion, Abbott made tax-deductible payments of $36 million, $83 million and $200 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008. In 2009 events occurred resulting in the remaining payments not being required and the remaining liability in the amount of $797 million was derecognized and recorded as income in Other (income) expense, net.

In 2010, Abbott management approved a restructuring plan primarily related to the acquisition of Solvay's pharmaceuticals business. This plan streamlines operations, improves efficiencies and reduces costs in certain Solvay sites and functions as well as in certain Abbott and Solvay commercial organizations in various countries. Action plans have been identified and most are expected to be implemented within the next two years. This plan will result in pretax charges of approximately $810 million to $970 million over the life of the plan. These charges include employee-related costs of approximately $650 million, accelerated depreciation and asset write-downs of approximately $105 million, and other related exit costs of up to approximately $215 million, mainly related to discontinuation of certain research and development programs and product transfers. Under this plan, Abbott recorded charges to Cost of products sold, Research and development and Selling, general and administrative of approximately $99 million, $152 million and $272 million, respectively. Additional charges of $12 million were subsequently recorded primarily for accelerated depreciation. The following summarizes the activity for this restructuring:

 Abbott has acquired and continues to acquire significant intangible assets that Abbott records at fair value. Transactions involving the purchase or sale of intangible assets occur with some frequency between companies in the health care field and valuations are usually based on a discounted cash flow analysis. The discounted cash flow model requires assumptions about the timing and amount of future net cash flows, risk, the cost of capital, terminal values and market participants. Each of these factors can significantly affect the value of the intangible asset. Abbott engages independent valuation experts who review Abbott's critical assumptions and calculations for acquisitions of significant intangibles. Abbott reviews definite-lived intangible assets for impairment each quarter using an undiscounted net cash flows approach. If the undiscounted cash flows of an intangible asset are less than the carrying value of an intangible asset, the intangible asset is written down to its fair value, which is usually the discounted cash flow amount. Where cash flows cannot be identified for an individual asset, the review is applied at the lowest group level for which cash flows are identifiable.

The increase in 2009 reflects the favorable effect of exchange rates which reduced research and development expense in 2009. Excluding the effect of exchange, research and development expenses increased 3.4 percent in 2009. The increase in 2007 was affected by the acquisitions of Guidant's vascular intervention and endovascular solutions businesses in April 2006 and Kos Pharmaceuticals Inc. in the fourth quarter of 2006. These increases, excluding the effects of exchange, also reflect continued pipeline spending, including programs in vascular devices, immunology, neuroscience, oncology, Hepatitis C and pain management.

An additional $81 million, $90 million and $70 million were subsequently recorded in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, relating to these restructurings, primarily for accelerated depreciation. In addition, Abbott implemented facilities restructuring plans in 2007 related to the acquired operations of Kos Pharmaceuticals Inc., which resulted in an increase to goodwill of approximately $52 million. Abbott expects to incur up to an additional $21 million in future periods for these restructuring plans, primarily for accelerated depreciation. The following summarizes the activity for these restructurings:
research and development
The income tax rates on earnings from continuing operations were 19.2 percent in 2008, 19.3 percent in 2007 and 24.6 percent in 2006. Taxes on earnings from continuing operations in 2006 reflect the effect of the tax rates applied to acquired in-process research and development and the resolution of prior years' income tax audits and the effect of other discrete tax items. For 2006, the tax rates applied to acquired in-process and collaborations research and development increased the effective tax rate by 6.6 percentage points and the effect of the income tax audit resolution and other discrete tax items decreased the effective tax rate by 5.5 percentage points. Abbott expects to apply an annual effective rate of between 17.5 percent and 18.0 percent in 2009.
research and development
In December 2006, Abbott acquired Kos Pharmaceuticals Inc. for cash of approximately $3.8 billion, net of cash held by Kos Pharmaceuticals Inc., to expand Abbott's presence in the lipid management market and to provide several on-market and late-stage pipeline products. Kos Pharmaceuticals Inc. was a specialty pharmaceutical company that developed and marketed proprietary medications for the treatment of chronic cardiovascular, metabolic and respiratory diseases. This business was acquired on December 13, 2006 and the financial results of the acquired operations are included in these financial statements beginning on that date. The acquisition was financed primarily with short-term debt. The allocation of the purchase price resulted in a charge of $1.3 billion for acquired in-process research and development, intangible assets of $821 million, goodwill (primarily non-deductible) of $1.6 billion and net liabilities, primarily deferred income taxes recorded at acquisition of $331 million. Acquired intangible assets are being amortized over 4 to 15 years. Non-deductible acquired in-process research and development was charged to income in 2006.

and Abbott paid Boston Scientific $250 million, resulting in the recording of additional goodwill. Government approval in Japan is anticipated in late 2009 or early 2010 which will also result in the recording of additional goodwill. The allocation of the purchase price resulted in a charge of $665 million for acquired in-process research and development, intangible assets of $1.2 billion, goodwill (primarily deductible) of $1.7 billion and tangible net assets of $580 million. Acquired intangible assets are being amortized over 4 to 15 years. Deductible acquired in-process research and development was charged to income in 2006. The net tangible assets acquired consist primarily of property and equipment of approximately $530 million, trade accounts receivable of approximately $250 million and inventories of approximately $120 million, net of assumed liabilities, primarily trade accounts payable, litigation reserves and other liabilities.
research and development
Net cash from operating activities of continuing operations amounted to $7.0 billion, $5.2 billion and $5.3 billion in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Cash from operating activities of continuing operations in 2008 compared to 2007 is higher due to higher operating earnings, decreased prepaid expenses and other assets, and increased trade accounts payable and other liabilities. Cash from operating activities of continuing operations in 2007 and 2006 compared to 2005 is higher due to higher net earnings adjusted for after-tax non-cash charges for acquired in-process research and development in 2006 and share-based compensation and higher contributions to retirement benefit plans in 2005 compared to 2007 and 2006; partially offset by higher income tax payments in 2006, including tax payments related to the 2005 remittances of foreign earnings under the American Jobs Creation Act. Abbott funds its domestic pension plans according to IRS funding limitations. In 2008, 2007 and 2006, $200 million was funded to the main domestic pension. Abbott expects pension funding for its main domestic pension plan of $700 million in 2009 and $200 million annually, thereafter. Abbott expects annual cash flow from operating activities to continue to exceed Abbott's capital expenditures and cash dividends.
research and development
Capital expenditures of $1.3 billion in 2008, $1.7 billion in 2007 and $1.3 billion in 2006 were principally for upgrading and expanding manufacturing, research and development, investments in information technology and administrative support facilities in all segments, and for laboratory instruments placed with customers.

In 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007) "Business Combinations" and SFAS No. 160 "Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements  an amendment of ARB No. 51." Abbott will adopt these standards on January 1, 2009. Statement No. 141 (revised 2007) will impact Abbott primarily in five areas: acquired in-process research and development will be accounted for as an indefinite lived intangible asset until approval or discontinuation rather than as expense; acquisition costs will be expensed rather than added to the cost of an acquisition; restructuring costs in connection with an acquisition will be expensed rather than added to the cost of an acquisition; the fair value of contingent consideration at the date of an acquisition will be included in the cost of an acquisition; and the fair value of contingent liabilities that are more likely than not of occurrence will be recorded at the date of an acquisition. The effect of these changes will be applicable to acquisitions on or after January 1, 2009. Adoption of Statement No. 160 will not have a material effect on Abbott.

Abbott's research and development efforts may not succeed in developing commercially successful products and technologies, which may cause Abbott's revenue and profitability to decline.
research and development
To remain competitive, Abbott must continue to launch new products and technologies. To accomplish this, Abbott commits substantial efforts, funds, and other resources to research and development. A high rate of failure is inherent in the research and development of new products and technologies. Abbott must make ongoing substantial expenditures without any assurance that its efforts will be commercially successful. Failure can occur at any point in the process, including after significant funds have been invested.
research and development
In the United States, including Puerto Rico, Abbott owns nine distribution centers. Outside the United States, Abbott owns eight distribution centers. Abbott also has eighteen United States research and development facilities located at: Abbott Park, Illinois; Alameda, California; Austin, Texas; Columbus, Ohio (two locations); Des Plaines, Illinois; East Windsor, New Jersey; Fairfield, California; Irving, Texas; Long Grove, Illinois; Mountain View, California; North Chicago, Illinois; Parsippany, New Jersey; Redwood City, California; Santa Clara, California (two locations); Temecula, California; and Worcester, Massachusetts. Outside the United States, Abbott has research and development facilities in Australia, Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Ireland, Japan, the Netherlands, South Africa, Spain, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom.

 Abbott has acquired and continues to acquire significant intangible assets that Abbott records at fair value. Those assets which do not yet have regulatory approval and for which there are no alternative uses are expensed as acquired in-process research and development, and those that have regulatory approval are capitalized. Transactions involving the purchase or sale of intangible assets occur with some frequency between companies in the health care field and valuations are usually based on a discounted cash flow analysis. The discounted cash flow model requires assumptions about the timing and amount of future net cash inflows, risk, the cost of capital, terminal values and market participants. Each of these factors can significantly affect the value of the intangible asset. Abbott engages independent valuation experts who review Abbott's critical assumptions and calculations for

drug-eluting stent increased research and development expenses by 6.3 percentage points over 2005. The increases in 2007 and 2006 were also affected by the acquisitions of Guidant's vascular intervention and endovascular solutions businesses in April 2006 and Kos Pharmaceuticals Inc. in the fourth quarter of 2006. These increases also reflect increased spending to support pipeline programs, including new indications for

In 2007, 2006 and 2005, Abbott management approved plans to realign its worldwide pharmaceutical and vascular manufacturing operations and selected domestic and international commercial and research and development operations in order to reduce costs. In 2007, 2006 and 2005, Abbott recorded pretax charges against earnings of approximately $107, $210 and $256, respectively, reflecting the impairment of manufacturing facilities and other assets, employee severance and other related charges. Approximately $94, $181 and $174, respectively, is classified as cost of products sold, $3, $29 and $10, respectively, as research and development and $10 in 2007 and $72 in 2005 as selling, general and administrative. Fair value for the determination of the amount of asset impairments was determined primarily based on a discounted cash flow method. An additional $90, $70 and $14 were subsequently recorded in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, relating to these restructurings, primarily for accelerated depreciation. In addition, Abbott implemented facilities restructuring plans in 2007 related to the acquired operations of Kos Pharmaceuticals Inc., which resulted in an increase to goodwill of approximately $52.

The income tax rates on earnings were 19.3 percent in 2007, 24.6 percent in 2006 and 27.0 percent in 2005. Taxes on earnings in 2006 reflect the effect of the tax rates applied to acquired in-process research and development and the resolution of prior years' income tax audits and the effect of other discrete tax items. For 2006, the tax rates applied to acquired in-process and collaborations research and development increased the effective tax rate by 6.6 percentage points and the effect of the income tax audit resolution and other discrete tax items decreased the effective tax rate by 5.5 percentage points. In 2005, Abbott remitted $4.3 billion of foreign earnings in accordance with the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 and recorded additional tax expense of $245 million, which increased the effective tax rate by approximately 5.3 percentage points. This was partially offset by adjustments of prior years' tax accounts resulting primarily from resolution of prior years' accrual requirements, which decreased the effective tax rate by 2.3 percentage points. Abbott expects to apply an annual effective rate of somewhat above 19 percent in 2008.

In developing assumptions for the valuation model, comparable Abbott products or products marketed by competitors were used to estimate pricing, margins and expense levels. As of December 31, 2007, the research efforts were primarily on schedule. The estimated projected costs to complete totaled approximately $390 million as of December 31, 2007, with anticipated product launch dates from 2008 through 2013. There have been no significant changes in the development plans for the acquired incomplete projects. Significant net cash inflows will commence within one to two years after product launch.

Net cash from operating activities amounted to $5.2 billion, $5.3 billion and $5.0 billion in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Cash from operating activities in 2007 and 2006 compared to 2005 is higher due to higher net earnings adjusted for after-tax non-cash charges for acquired in-process research and development in 2006 and share-based compensation and higher contributions to retirement benefit plans in 2005 compared to 2007 and 2006; partially offset by higher income tax payments in 2006, including tax payments related to the 2005 remittances of foreign earnings under the American Jobs Creation Act. Abbott funds its domestic pension plans according to IRS funding limitations. In 2007 and 2006, $200 million was funded to the main domestic pension plan and in 2005, $641 million was funded to the main domestic pension plan. Abbott expects pension funding for its main domestic pension plan of $200 million annually. The increased contribution in 2005 was due, in part, to the investment of cash remitted under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. Abbott expects annual cash flow from operating activities to continue to exceed Abbott's capital expenditures and cash dividends.

Abbott reviews intangible assets for impairment each quarter using an undiscounted net cash flows approach. If the undiscounted cash flows of an intangible asset are less than the carrying value of an intangible asset, the intangible asset is written down to its fair value, which is usually the discounted cash flow amount. Where cash flows cannot be identified for an individual asset, the review is applied at the lowest group level for which cash flows are identifiable. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually or

In 2006 and 2005, Abbott management approved plans to realign its worldwide pharmaceutical manufacturing operations and selected domestic and international commercial and research and development operations in order to reduce costs. In 2006 and 2005, Abbott recorded pretax charges against earnings of approximately $210 and $256, respectively, reflecting the impairment of manufacturing facilities and other assets, employee severance and other related charges. Approximately $181 and $174, respectively, is classified as cost of products sold, $29 and $10, respectively, as research and development and $72, in 2005, as selling, general and administrative. An additional $70 and $14 were subsequently recorded in 2006 and 2005, respectively, relating to these restructurings, primarily for accelerated depreciation. As a result of product re-registration timelines required under manufacturing regulations in a number of countries, manufacturing related realignments are expected to continue into 2007.

The effective income tax rates on income from continuing operations were 24.6 percent in 2006, 27.0 percent in 2005 and 23.0 percent in 2004. Taxes on earnings in 2006 reflect the effect of the tax rates applied to acquired in-process and collaborations research and development and the resolution of prior years income tax audits and the effect of discrete tax events. For 2006, the tax rates applied to acquired in-process and collaborations research and development increased the effective tax rate by 6.6 percentage points and the effect of the income tax audit resolution and discrete tax events decreased the effective tax rate by 5.5 percentage points. In 2005, Abbott remitted $4.3 billion of foreign earnings in accordance with the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 and recorded additional tax expense of $245 million, which increased the effective tax rate by approximately 5.3 percentage points. This was partially offset by adjustments of prior years tax accounts resulting primarily from resolution of prior years accrual requirements, which decreased the effective tax rate by 2.3 percentage points. The effective tax rate for 2004 reflects adjustments of prior years tax requirements primarily as a result of resolutions of prior years tax audits and the effect of non-deductible acquired in-process research and development. The effect of these items for 2004 was to decrease the effective tax rate by approximately 1.2 percentage points. Abbott expects to apply an annual effective rate of approximately 22.5 percent in 2007.

In 2005, Abbott acquired the remaining interest in a small medical products company that was previously accounted for under the equity method of accounting and a less than 50 percent equity interest in a small medical products company. The aggregate cash purchase price was approximately $25 million. Acquisition accounting resulted in the recording of non-tax deductible goodwill of approximately $69 million, intangible assets of approximately $22 million and a charge of approximately $17 million for acquired in-process research and development. In 2005, Abbott acquired additional rights related to

In 2004, Abbott acquired TheraSense, Inc., a leader in the development, manufacturing and marketing of blood glucose self-monitoring systems, for approximately $1.2 billion in cash; i-STAT Corporation, a manufacturer of point-of-care diagnostic products for blood analysis, for approximately $394 million in cash; EAS, a nutritional company with a portfolio of nationally recognized brands, for approximately $320 million in cash; and Spine Next, a manufacturer of orthopedic spinal implant devices, for approximately $58 million in cash plus additional milestone payments of up to $23 million upon achievement of future targets. Abbott also acquired certain other product technologies for approximately $352 million. These acquisitions resulted in a charge of $271 million for acquired in-process research and development, intangible assets of approximately $1.3 billion, non-tax deductible goodwill of approximately $923 million and deferred income taxes of approximately $406 million. Acquired intangible assets, primarily trade names, are amortized over 5 to 20 years (average of approximately 14 years).

Net cash from operating activities of continuing operations amounted to $5.3 billion, $5.0 billion and $4.3 billion in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The increase in cash from operating activities in 2006 compared to 2005 is due to higher net earnings adjusted for after-tax non-cash charges for acquired in-process research and development and share-based compensation and higher contributions to retirement benefit plans in 2005 compared to 2006; partially offset by higher income tax payments in 2006, including tax payments related to the 2005 remittances of foreign earnings under the American Jobs Creation Act. In 2006, 2005 and 2004, $200 million, $641 million and $482 million, respectively, was contributed to the main domestic defined benefit plan. Abbott expects pension funding for its main domestic pension plan of $200 million annually. The increased contribution in 2005 was due, in part, to the investment of cash remitted under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. Abbott expects annual cash flow from operating activities to continue to exceed Abbotts capital expenditures and cash dividends.

Subsequent to Abbott's 2001 acquisition of the Knoll pharmaceutical business, which significantly increased the scale of Abbott's pharmaceutical business, Abbott focused on reorganizing and growing its global pharmaceutical business. Abbott has established a global research and development organization and a global manufacturing and distribution organization to serve its domestic and international commercial pharmaceutical operations. Pharmaceutical research and development is focused on five therapeutic areas  immunology, oncology, neuroscience, diabetes/metabolism, and viral diseases. U.S. commercial pharmaceutical operations are focused mainly on primary care and specialty pharmaceuticals. In 2003, Abbott began the worldwide launch of

In 2005, TAP received an approvable letter from the FDA for febuxostat. Contingent upon FDA approval, TAP plans to launch febuxostat in 2006. Pharmaceutical research and development efforts will continue to be focused in the five therapeutic areas noted above with a significant portion of the development expenditures allocated to new
research and development
 Abbott has acquired and continues to acquire significant intangible assets that Abbott records at fair value. Those assets which do not yet have regulatory approval and for which there are no alternative uses are expensed as acquired in-process research and development, and those that have regulatory approval are capitalized. Transactions involving the purchase or sale of intangible assets occur with some frequency between companies in the health care field, and valuations are usually based on a discounted cash flow analysis using market participant assumptions. Abbott uses a discounted cash flow model to value most of its acquired intangible assets. The discounted cash flow model requires assumptions about the timing and amount of future net cash inflows, risk, the cost of capital, and terminal values. Each of these factors can significantly affect the value of the intangible asset. Abbott engages independent valuation experts who review Abbott's critical assumptions and calculations for significant acquisitions of intangibles. Abbott reviews intangible assets for impairment each quarter using an undiscounted net cash flows approach. If the undiscounted cash flows of an intangible asset are less than the carrying value of an intangible asset, the intangible asset is written down to its fair value, which is usually the discounted cash flow amount. Where cash flows cannot be identified for an individual asset, the review is applied at the lowest group level for which cash flows are identifiable. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually or when an event that could result in an impairment of goodwill occurs. At December 31, 2005 goodwill and intangibles amounted to $5.2 billion and $4.7 billion, respectively, and amortization expense for intangible assets amounted to approximately $490 million in 2005. There were no impairments of goodwill in 2005, 2004 or 2003.

Research and development expense, excluding acquired in-process research and development, was $1.8 billion in 2005, $1.7 billion in 2004 and $1.6 billion in 2003 and represented increases of 7.3 percent in 2005, 4.5 percent in 2004 and 10.1 percent in 2003. The majority of research and development expenditures are concentrated on pharmaceutical products.

In 2005, Abbott management approved plans to realign its global manufacturing operations and selected domestic and international commercial operations. In 2005, Abbott recorded pretax charges against earnings of approximately $256 reflecting the impairment of manufacturing facilities and other assets, employee severance and other related charges. Approximately $174 is classified as cost of products sold, $10 as research and development and $72 as selling, general and administrative. An additional $14 was subsequently recorded in 2005 relating to these restructurings, primarily for accelerated depreciation. As a result of product re-registration timelines required under manufacturing regulations in a number of countries, manufacturing related realignments are expected to continue into 2007.

The effective income tax rates on income from continuing operations were 27.0 percent in 2005, 23.0 percent in 2004 and 26.1 percent in 2003. In 2005, Abbott remitted $4.3 billion of foreign earnings in accordance with the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 and recorded additional tax expense of $245 million, which increased the effective tax rate by approximately 5.3 percentage points. This was partially offset by adjustments of prior years' tax accounts resulting primarily from resolution of prior years' accrual requirements, which decreased the effective tax rate by 2.3 percentage points. The effective tax rate for 2004 reflects adjustments of prior years' tax requirements primarily as a result of resolutions of prior years' tax audits and the effect of non-deductible acquired in-process research and development. The effect of these items for 2004 was to decrease the effective tax rate by approximately 1.2 percentage points. The effective tax rate for 2003 includes the effect of the charge for the settlement of the Ross enteral nutritional investigation and the charges for acquired in-process research and development. The effect of these charges for 2003 was to increase the effective tax rate by approximately 2.4 percentage points. Abbott expects to apply an annual effective rate of between 23.5 percent and 24.0 percent in 2006.

 Abbott has acquired and continues to acquire significant intangible assets that Abbott values and records. Those assets which do not yet have regulatory approval and for which there are no alternative uses are expensed as acquired in-process research and development, and those that have regulatory approval are capitalized. Transactions involving the purchase or sale of intangible assets occur with some frequency between companies in the health care field, and valuations are usually based on a discounted cash flow analysis. Abbott uses a discounted cash flow model to value acquired intangible assets. The discounted cash flow model requires assumptions about the timing and amount of future net cash inflows, risk, the cost of capital, and terminal values. Each of these factors can significantly affect the value of the intangible asset. Abbott engages independent valuation experts who review Abbott's critical assumptions and calculations for significant acquisitions of intangibles. Abbott reviews intangible assets for impairment each quarter using an undiscounted net cash flows approach. If the undiscounted cash flows of an intangible asset are less than the carrying value of an intangible asset, the intangible asset is written down to its fair value, which is usually the discounted cash flow amount. Where cash flows cannot be identified for an individual asset, the review is applied at the lowest group level for which cash flows are identifiable. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually or when an event that could result in an impairment of goodwill occurs. During the last three years, the increase in acquired intangible assets, net of amortization, and goodwill amounted to approximately $3.2 billion and $3.8 billion, respectively. Amortization of intangible assets amounted to approximately $363 million in 2003.
research and development
Research and development expense, excluding acquired in-process research and development, was $1.7 billion in 2003 and $1.6 billion in 2002 and 2001, and represented 8.8 percent of net sales in 2003 and 2002 compared to 9.7 percent of net sales in 2001. The decline in research and development as a percentage of sales in 2003 and 2002 compared to 2001 was due, in part, to the decline in spending on Phase III clinical trials in 2003 and 2002. The majority of research and development expenditures are concentrated on pharmaceutical products.
research and development
The effective income tax rates were 26.3 percent in 2003, 24.0 percent in 2002 and 17.7 percent in 2001. The effective tax rate for 2003 includes the effect of the charge for the settlement of the Ross enteral nutritional investigation and the charges for acquired in-process research and development. The effect of these substantially nondeductible charges for 2003 was to increase the effective tax rate by approximately 2.3 percentage points. The 2001 tax rate is lower than the 2003 and 2002 tax rates due primarily to the effect of the benefit of tax exemptions in several taxing jurisdictions in relation to Abbott's lower pretax income in 2001 compared to 2003 and 2002. This had the effect of decreasing the effective tax rate by 8.3 percentage points. The 2002 tax rate is lower than the 2001 tax rate, excluding the effects of the acquisitions of the pharmaceutical business of BASF and of Vysis, Inc. in 2001, due in part to the domestic dividend exclusion applicable to the increased earnings of TAP Pharmaceutical Products Inc. Abbott expects to apply an annual effective rate of 24.5 percent in 2004 due, in part, to the comparatively lower benefit from the domestic dividend exclusion compared to Abbott's total pretax income. Acquired in-process research and development relating to pending 2004 business acquisitions, as discussed below, will be tax effected at discrete tax rates.
research and development
In 2003, Abbott acquired ZonePerfect Nutritional Company, a marketer of healthy and nutritious products for active people, for approximately $160 million in cash; Integrated Vascular Systems, Inc., a developer of a novel vessel closure technology, for approximately $65 million in cash; and Spinal Concepts Inc., a marketer of spinal fixation products used in the treatment of spinal disorders, diseases and injuries for approximately $166 million, in cash, plus additional milestone payments of up to $40 million if agreed upon targets are met. In 2003, Abbott also acquired the assets of JOMED N.V.'s coronary and peripheral interventional business for approximately $68 million in cash. These acquisitions resulted in a charge of approximately $100 million for acquired in-process research and development, intangible assets of approximately $222 million and non-tax deductible goodwill of approximately $182 million. Acquired intangible assets, primarily product technology, will be amortized over 9 to 25 years (average of approximately 16 years). Had these acquisitions taken place on January 1 of the previous year, consolidated sales and income would not have been significantly different from reported amounts.
research and development
In 2002, Abbott acquired the cardiovascular stent business of Biocompatibles International plc and certain cardiovascular stent technology rights from Medtronic, Inc. In addition, Abbott acquired an additional 28.8 percent of the issued common shares of Hokuriku Seiyaku Co., Ltd., resulting in Abbott owning substantially all of the common shares of Hokuriku Seiyaku Co., Ltd. The aggregate cash purchase price ($586 million) of these strategic business and technology acquisitions resulted in a pretax charge for acquired in-process research and development of approximately $108 million, intangible assets of approximately $145 million and non-tax deductible goodwill of approximately $257 million. Acquired intangible assets, primarily product technology, are amortized over 4 to 13 years (average of approximately 8 years). Had these acquisitions taken place on January 1 of the previous year, consolidated sales and income would not have been significantly different from reported amounts.
research and development
On March 2, 2001, Abbott acquired, for cash, the pharmaceutical business of BASF, which included the global operations of Knoll Pharmaceuticals, for approximately $7.2 billion. This acquisition was financed primarily with short- and long-term debt and is accounted for under the purchase method of accounting. The acquisition cost has been allocated to intangible assets, $3.5 billion; goodwill, $2.4 billion; acquired in-process research and development, $1.2 billion; and net tangible assets, $0.1 billion, based on an independent appraisal of fair values. Product rights for marketed products are amortized on a straight-line basis over 10 to 16 years (average 13 years), and goodwill was amortized in 2001 on a straight-line basis over 20 years. Acquired in-process research and development was charged to expense in 2001. The net tangible assets acquired consist primarily of property and equipment of approximately $630 million, trade accounts receivable of approximately $402 million, and inventories of approximately $275 million, net of assumed liabilities, primarily trade accounts payable and other liabilities. Prior to the date of acquisition, Abbott began to plan for the integration and restructuring of the business. In 2001 and 2002, Abbott formally approved several restructuring plans and certain costs of implementing formally approved plans have been included as goodwill. Had this acquisition taken place on January 1, 2000, pro forma consolidated sales for 2001 would have been $16.7 billion, pro forma net income would have been $2.3 billion and pro forma diluted earnings per share would have been $1.46.
research and development
In 2001, Abbott acquired, for cash, all of the outstanding common stock of Vysis, Inc., a leading genomic disease management company. Of the cash acquisition cost of approximately $362 million, $162 million was allocated to developed technology, which is amortized over 15 years, and $143 million was charged against earnings in 2001 for acquired in-process research and development. The remaining acquisition cost was allocated to net tangible assets and goodwill. Had this acquisition taken place on January 1 of the previous year, consolidated sales and income would not have been significantly different from reported amounts.
research and development
In January 2004, Abbott announced that it has entered into an agreement to acquire all of the capital stock of TheraSense, Inc., a leader in the development, manufacturing and marketing of blood glucose self-monitoring systems, for $1.2 billion in cash. The completion of the acquisition is subject to approval by the holders of a majority of TheraSense common stock, regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions and is expected to close in the second quarter of 2004. In addition, in January 2004, Abbott acquired, for approximately $392 million in cash, the shares of i-STAT Corporation, a leading manufacturer of point-of-care diagnostic systems for blood analysis, which Abbott did not already own. In 2004, Abbott expects to record a charge of approximately $171 million for acquired in-process research and development, the amount of which is subject to the final appraisal, and approximately $115 million for restructuring and integration costs in connection with these acquisitions.
research and development
Capital expenditures of $1.2 billion in 2003, $1.3 billion in 2002, and $1.2 billion in 2001 were principally for upgrading and expanding manufacturing, research and development, investments in information technology and administrative support facilities in all segments, and for laboratory instruments and hospital equipment placed with customers. This level of capital expenditures is expected to be lower in 2004 following the spin-off of Hospira. An increased proportion of the capital expenditures will be dedicated to the International and Pharmaceutical Products segments.
research and development
In 2002, as discussed in Note 10, Abbott announced restructuring plans to align Abbott's global manufacturing operations with its scientific focus and to achieve greater operating efficiencies in its Diagnostic Products and International segments. In 2002, Abbott recorded a pretax charge against earnings of $174, reflecting the impairment of manufacturing facilities and other assets, and employee severance charges. Approximately $83 is classified as Cost of products sold, $5 as Research and development, and $86 as Selling, general and administrative. The restructuring plans resulted in the elimination of approximately 2,100 net positions. Employee groups covered under the restructuring plans included manufacturing, research and development, and sales and administrative-related functions. The accrued restructuring reserve balance at December 31, 2003 of approximately $23 relates primarily to employee severance obligations, which, by local laws must be paid over time.

In 2001 and 2002, as discussed in Note 10, Abbott implemented restructuring plans related to the operations of the acquired pharmaceutical business of BASF and the closing of one of Abbott's manufacturing operations. In 2001, of the total $207 restructuring charges, $156 was recorded as goodwill associated with the acquisition of the pharmaceutical business of BASF. Of the amount expensed, approximately $36 is classified as Cost of products sold, $2 as Research and development, and $13 as Selling, general and administrative. Employee-related costs are primarily severance pay, relocation of former BASF employees and outplacement services. The restructuring plans resulted in the elimination of approximately 2,400 positions. Employee groups covered under the restructuring plans included manufacturing, research and development, and sales and administrative-related functions. In 2002, a $59 restructuring charge was recorded as goodwill associated with the acquisition of the pharmaceutical business of BASF.

Of the $207.0 total restructuring charges, $155.5 has been recorded as goodwill associated with the acquisition of the pharmaceutical business of BASF. Of the amount expensed, approximately $35.8 is classified as cost of products sold, $13.3 as selling, general and administrative, and $2.4 as research and development. Employee-related costs are primarily severance pay, relocation of former BASF employees and outplacement services. Approved restructuring plans cover 2,393 employees, of which approximately 1,200 were severed by year end. Employee groups covered under the restructuring plans include manufacturing, research and development, and sales and administrative-related functions.

Acquisition costs will generally be expensed as incurred; non-controlling interests will be valued at fair value at the acquisition date; in-process research and development will be recorded at fair value as an indefinite-lived intangible asset at the acquisition date; restructuring costs associated with a business combination will generally be expensed subsequent to the acquisition date; and changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and income tax uncertainties after the acquisition date generally will affect income tax expense. SFAS 141(R) will be effective on a prospective basis for all business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual period subsequent to December 15, 2008, with the exception of the accounting for valuation allowances on deferred taxes and acquired tax contingencies.

Our peer group was reviewed with FW Cook in fiscal 2017 and at that time, it was decided to change our peer group to a new peer group consisting of 15 companies selected by us to reflect our current business strategy of focusing more on the end market pharmaceutical space. These companies included in the peer group reflect Aceto’s business strategy, placing greater emphasis on companies whose primary business is tied to health care. The selection criteria to evaluate the peer group companies included comparable business content/model, company size, business characteristics and executive talent. During the fiscal year, we reviewed our peer group with FW Cook and determined that Albany Molecular Research and Sagent Pharmaceuticals, which were in the peer group in 2017, were acquired and were replaced by AMAG Pharmaceuticals Inc. and Luminex Corp. During the 2018 fiscal year, the peer group companies included: Akorn Inc., AMAG Pharmaceuticals Inc., American Vanguard Corporation, Amphastar Pharmaceuticals, ANI Pharmaceuticals, Cambrex Corporation, Depomed, Impax Laboratories, Inc., Innophos Holdings, Inc., Lannett Company, Inc., Lawson Products, Inc., Luminex Corp., Prestige Brand Holdings, Inc., Quaker Chemical Corporation and Usana Health Sciences, Inc. AMAG Pharmaceuticals Inc. was added because it increased the weighting of pharmaceutical companies in the peer group and has similar revenue and market cap to Aceto. Luminex Corp. was added to the peer group during the 2018 fiscal year due to its strong focus on research and development. During the 2018 fiscal year, our compensation consultant conducted a benchmarking review consisting of a competitive review of executive compensation levels for certain executive officers, including our named executive officers. The analysis focused on target compensation in order to provide market competitive comparisons for setting executive compensation opportunities. The Compensation Committee’s benchmarking criteria for these purposes included comparisons of executive base salary compensation, performance awards, long term incentive compensation, total cash compensation (base salary plus annual performance awards), and total direct compensation (total cash compensation plus long-term incentive compensation) of our peer group. Based upon the results of the study, it was determined that Aceto’s executive officers cash compensation generally approximates median levels and most executive officers target bonus was at or above the median. For long-term incentives, the Company’s executive officers were positioned slightly below the market median. Aceto’s target total direct compensation was positioned approximately 11% above the market overall median. The overall positioning at median is aligned with Aceto’s strategy for fiscal 2018 of aggregate positioning at the market median and increased emphasis on long-term incentives as compared to cash compensation.

Selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A) increased $7,189, or 12.7%, to $63,855 for the year ended June 30, 2013 compared to $56,666 for the prior year. As a percentage of sales, SG&A remained constant at 12.8% for the year ended June 30, 2013 versus the prior year. The primary reasons for the increase in SG&A are $3,244 additional accrued contingent consideration related to the Rising acquisition as well as increased research and development expenses related to certain Rising products and increased information technology maintenance and software related costs. We also experienced additional accrued performance award expense and increased fringe benefits and stock-based compensation expense due to increased financial performance. During fiscal 2012, the Company recorded approximately $884 of one-time costs associated with the separation of certain executive management employees, as well as $761 additional accrued contingent consideration related to the Rising acquisition.

As a percentage of sales, SG&A decreased to 12.9% for the year ended June 30, 2010 versus 13.6% for the prior year. In the second quarter of fiscal 2010, approximately $2,587 of one-time costs associated with the separation of the Company’s former Chairman of the Board of Directors and CEO, were recorded. In addition, the Company completed an SG&A rationalization review and recorded charges of approximately $1,215 for personnel related costs in conjunction with its cost reduction efforts. The increase in SG&A is partially offset by a decline of $2,293 in personnel related costs due to decreased accrued bonus expense, decrease in fringe benefits and a decline in stock-based compensation expense. SG&A also decreased due to a $436 drop in sales and marketing expenses. In addition, in the prior period, we had $153 in research and development expenses (R&D) with no comparable amount in fiscal 2010 due to the abandonment in fiscal 2009 of R&D related to two finished dosage form generic pharmaceutical products that were to be distributed in Europe.

Our products are regulated by the FCC in the U.S. and similar agencies in other countries where we offer our products. Consequently, we and our customers could be positively or negatively affected by the rules and regulations adopted from time to time by the FCC or regulatory agencies in other countries. For example, our wireless communications products, including two-way LMRs, are subject to FCC regulations related to radio frequency spectrum. As a result of limited spectrum availability, the FCC has mandated that new LMR equipment utilize technology that is more spectrum-efficient, which effectively meant that the industry had to migrate to digital technology. These types of mandates may provide us with new business opportunities or may require us to modify all or some of our products so that they can continue to be manufactured and marketed, which may lead to an increase in our capital expenditures and research and development expenses.

The Company accounts for the costs of software within its products whereby certain software costs incurred subsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility are capitalized and amortized over the estimated lives of the related products. The Company determines technological feasibility to be established upon the internal release of a detailed program design as specified by Topic 985-20. Upon the general release of the product to customers, development costs for that product are amortized over periods not exceeding five years, based on current and future revenue of the product. Net capitalized software costs totaled $370 and $753 as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Company’s amortization expense for capitalized software was approximately $383 and $725, respectively.

As of December 31, 2015, the Company had a net deferred tax asset of approximately $5,706, offset by deferred tax liabilities of $245 derived from the unrealized gain on available-for-sale securities. This asset is primarily composed of net operating loss carryforwards (NOLs), research and development costs and tax credits, and an allowance for inventory. The NOLs total $4,898 for federal and $12,660 for state purposes, with expirations starting in 2018 through 2030. Included in the Company’s NOLs as of December 31, 2015 is approximately $1,009 from the exercises of stock options. The benefit from utilization of this portion of the NOL, which equates to a deferred tax asset of approximately $380 and is reserved through a valuation allowance at December 31, 2015, will be recorded as a debit to valuation allowance and credit to additional paid in capital when the related deferred tax asset is realized.

During 2011 and 2010 the Company utilized $4,160 and generated $106, respectively, of its NOLs. The NOL utilization assumes an election under §59(e) to capitalize and amortize certain tax preferences – specifically §174(a) research and development expenditures. The deferred tax asset amounts are based upon management’s conclusions regarding, among other considerations, the Company’s current and anticipated customer base, contracts, and product introductions, certain tax planning strategies, and management’s estimates of future earnings based on information currently available, as well as recent operating results during 2011, 2010, and 2009. ASC Topic 740 “Income Taxes” requires that all positive and negative evidence be analyzed to determine if, based on the weight of available evidence, the Company is more likely than not to realize the benefit of the deferred tax asset.

For 2002, 2001, and 2000, RELM's research, development and engineering expenditures were approximately $1.9 million, $1.4 million, and $1.2 million, respectively. The use of strategic technology partners has enabled us to contain and, in some instances, even reduce R&D expenditures while concentrating on key initiatives, such as the APCO Project 25 digital program. In this connection, costs incurred to date aggregated approximately $0.6 million and we estimate additional costs of $ 1.2 million over the remaining life of the project. Products from these research, development and engineering projects will be completed and introduced at various times through 2005.

Our engineers and other research and development employees also develop design specifications based on customer requirements and supervise quality assurance activities. Our research and development team actively assists in the implementation of product designs, with primary responsibility for applied engineering, production engineering and the supervision of contract manufacturers. Other activities include ongoing engineering and quality assurance.

research and development
Engineering, Research and Development As of December 31, 2000, we had ten employees who devote all or a portion of their time to engineering, research, and development. We also utilize third party alliances as a supplement to internal research and development. For example, we are currently utilizing VDV Media, Inc. to develop multi-site dispatch capabilities for our Uniden Esas system products. Expenses for maintenance-of-line engineering as well as research and development totaled $1.2 million, $1.5 million, and $2.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999, and 1998, respectively. We anticipate that we will execute our plan for the development of APCO Project 25 compliant products in 2001, if we are able to raise the necessary funds to execute our plan.
r&d
Engineering and R&D spending in 2000 was reduced from the previous year by approximately $200,000 (13.5%) as our most significant new product initiative, the GMH series radios, was completed. We have developed a comprehensive plan to engineer and manufacture digital products that are compliant with the specifications of APCO Project 25, and we have engaged Janney Montgomery Securities, an investment banker, to assist in obtaining the capital that is required to execute this plan.
r&d
Selling, general, and administrative expenses (SG&A) include commissions, marketing, sales, sustaining engineering, product development, management information, accounting, and headquarters. For the year ended December 31, 1999, SG&A expenses totaled $7.5 million or 33.5% of net sales compared with $9.9 million or 33.4% for the prior year. As a result of our restructuring and the sale or discontinuation of certain businesses and product lines, 16 employees and approximately $1.2 million in expenses were eliminated from the SG&A cost structure. R&D spending was reduced $794,000 compared to the prior year as our major R&D project was largely completed. Legal expenses increased during the year as a result of defending litigation that was brought against RELM.

Our business will suffer if we are unable to keep pace with rapid technological changes and product development in our industry. The market for our LMR products is characterized by ongoing technological development, evolving industry standards and frequent product introductions. The LMR industry is experiencing a transition from analog products to digital products. In addition, new standards for LMR compatibility (the APCO 25 Standards) have been adopted and the market demand for APCO 25 compliant products is growing. Our future success and prospects for growth will depend upon our ability to enhance current products and to introduce new products which address these and other technological and market developments and satisfy the increasingly sophisticated needs of customers, all in a timely manner. Digital and APCO 25 compliant products are already being brought to the market by several of our competitors. We have not yet offered a digital product or products which are compatible with the APCO 25 standards. Bringing such products to market and achieving a significant share of the market for these products will require substantial expenditures of funds to complete research and development and extensive marketing to achieve market penetration. In order to bring the APCO 25 compliant products to market, we will need additional financing. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in developing and marketing, on a timely basis, fully functional digital products or new products that respond to other technological advances by competitors, or that our new products will be accepted by customers. An inability to successfully compete could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Depreciation, depletion and amortization of the cost of proved oil and gas properties is calculated using the unit-of-production method. The reserve base or denominator used to calculate depreciation, depletion and amortization for leasehold acquisition costs and the cost to acquire proved properties is the sum of proved developed reserves and proved undeveloped reserves. For lease and well equipment, development costs and successful exploration drilling costs, the reserve base includes only proved developed reserves. The numerator for such calculation is actual production volumes for the period. All other property and equipment is depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated average useful lives of three to twenty years.

Future success depends in part on the Company’s ability to find, develop and acquire additional oil and natural gas reserves. Absent ongoing successful acquisition or exploration activities, reserves and revenues will decline as a result of current reserves being depleted by production. The successful acquisition, development or exploration of oil and natural gas properties is dependent upon an assessment of recoverable reserves, future oil and natural gas prices and operating costs, potential environmental and other liabilities, and other factors. These factors are necessarily inexact. As a result, the Company may not recover the purchase price and/or the development costs of a property from the sale of production from the property, or may not recognize an acceptable return from properties acquired. In addition, exploration and development operations may not result in any increases in reserves. Exploration or development may be delayed or cancelled as a result of inadequate capital, compliance with governmental regulations, price controls or mechanical difficulties. In the future, the cost to find or acquire additional reserves may become prohibitive.

The statements in this report include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and beliefs and involve numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date hereof or as of the dates indicated in the statements and should not be relied upon as predictions of future events, as we cannot assure you that the events or circumstances reflected in these statements will be achieved or will occur. You can identify forward-looking statements by the use of forward-looking terminology including “believes,” “expects,” “may,” “will,” “should,” “seeks,” “intends,” “plans,” “pro forma,” “estimates,” “anticipates,” or the negative of these words and phrases, other variations of these words and phrases or comparable terminology. The forward-looking statements relate to, among other things: possible impact of future accounting rules on AMD’s consolidated financial statements; demand for AMD’s products; the growth, change and competitive landscape of the markets in which AMD participates; the nature and extent of AMD’s future payments to GLOBALFOUNDRIES Inc. (GF) and the materiality of these payments; the materiality of AMD’s future purchases from GF; AMD’s ability to meet its wafer purchase target; the expected amounts to be received by AMD under the IP licensing agreement and AMD’s expected royalty payments from future product sales of China JVs’ products to be developed on the basis of such licensed IP; sales patterns of AMD’s PC products and semi-custom System-on-Chip (SoC) products for game consoles; the level of international sales as compared to total sales; international sales will continue to be a significant portion of total sales in the foreseeable future; that other unrecognized tax benefits will not materially change in the next 12 months; that AMD’s cash and cash equivalents balances together with the availability under that certain secured revolving line of credit (Secured Revolving Line of Credit) made available to AMD and certain of its subsidiaries under the Amended and Restated Loan Agreement, will be sufficient to fund AMD’s operations including capital expenditures over the next 12 months; AMD’s ability to obtain sufficient external financing on favorable terms, or at all; AMD’s expectation that based on the information presently known to management, the potential liability related to AMD’s current litigation will not have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, cash flows or results of operations; any amounts in addition to what has been already accrued by AMD for future remediation costs under clean-up orders will not be material; we expect to file future patent applications in both the United States and abroad on significant inventions, as we deem appropriate; anticipated increase in costs related to enhancing, implementing and monitoring information security controls, remediating any data security breaches and addressing related litigation, mitigating reputational harm and compliance with external regulations related to our IT assets; we expect to receive $448.5 million upon the exercise of a warrant by West Coast Hitech L.P. (WCH) and issue 75 million shares of our common stock to WCH; revenue allocated to remaining performance obligations that are unsatisfied which will be recognized over the next 12 months; and a small number of customers will continue to account for a substantial part of AMD’s revenue in the future. Material factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from current expectations include, without limitation, the following: Intel Corporation’s dominance of the microprocessor market and its aggressive business practices may limit AMD’s ability to compete effectively; AMD has a wafer supply agreement with GF with obligations to purchase all of its microprocessor and APU product requirements, and a certain portion of its GPU product requirements, manufactured at process nodes larger than 7 nanometer (nm) from GF with limited exceptions. If GF is not able to satisfy AMD’s manufacturing requirements, AMD’s business could be adversely impacted; AMD relies on third parties to manufacture its products, and if they are unable to do so on a timely basis in sufficient quantities and using competitive technologies, AMD’s business could be materially adversely affected; failure to achieve expected manufacturing yields for AMD’s products could negatively impact its financial results; the success of AMD’s business is dependent upon its ability to introduce products on a timely basis with features and performance levels that provide value to its customers while supporting and coinciding with significant industry transitions; if AMD cannot generate sufficient revenue and operating cash flow or obtain external financing, it may face a cash shortfall and be unable to make all of its planned investments in research and development or other strategic investments; the loss of a significant customer may have a material adverse effect on AMD; AMD’s receipt of revenue from its semi-custom SoC products is dependent upon its technology being designed into third-party products and the success of those products; global economic and market uncertainty may adversely impact AMD’s business and operating results; AMD’s products may be subject to security vulnerabilities that could have a material adverse effect on AMD; IT outages, data loss, data breaches and cyber-attacks could compromise AMD’s intellectual property or other sensitive information, be costly to remediate and cause significant damage to its business, reputation and operations; AMD’s operating results are subject to quarterly and seasonal sales patterns; AMD may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service its debt obligations or meet its working capital requirements; AMD has a large amount of indebtedness which could adversely affect its financial position and prevent it from implementing its strategy or fulfilling its contractual obligations; the agreements governing AMD’s notes and the Secured Revolving Line of Credit impose restrictions on AMD that may adversely affect AMD’s ability

Intel has substantially greater financial resources than we do and accordingly spends substantially greater amounts on marketing and research and development than we do. We expect Intel to maintain its market position and to continue to invest heavily in marketing, research and development, new manufacturing facilities and other technology companies.

Our principal competitor in the discrete graphics market is Nvidia and they are considered the market share leader. Other competitors include a number of smaller companies, which may have greater flexibility to address specific market needs, but less financial resources to do so, especially as we believe that the growing complexity of graphics processors and the associated research and development costs represent an increasingly higher barrier to entry in this market.

We focus our research and development activities on improving product performance and enhancing product design. Our main area of focus is on delivering the next generation of CPU and GPU IP, and designing that IP into our SoCs for our next generation of products, with, in each case, improved system performance and performance-per-watt characteristics. For example, we are focusing on improving the battery life of our APU products for notebooks and the performance and power efficiency of our discrete GPUs and our microprocessors for servers. We are also focusing on delivering a range of low-power integrated platforms to serve key markets, including commercial clients, mobile computing and gaming. We believe that these platforms will bring customers increased performance and energy efficiency. We also work with industry leaders on process technology, software and other functional intellectual property and with others in the industry and industry consortia to conduct early stage research and development. We conduct product and system research and development activities for our products in the United States with additional design and development engineering teams located in Australia, China, Canada, India, Singapore and Taiwan, who undertake specific activities at the direction of our U.S. headquarters.

Intel has substantially greater financial resources than we do and accordingly spends substantially greater amounts on marketing and research and development than we do. We expect Intel to maintain its market position and to continue to invest heavily in marketing, research and development, new manufacturing facilities and other technology companies. To the extent Intel manufactures a significantly larger portion of its microprocessor products using more advanced process technologies, or introduces competitive new products into the market before we do, we may be more vulnerable to Intel’s aggressive marketing and pricing strategies for microprocessor products.
research and development
Our success depends to a significant extent on the development, qualification, implementation and acceptance of new product designs and improvements that provide value to our customers. Our ability to develop, qualify and distribute, and have manufactured, new products and related technologies to meet evolving industry requirements, at prices acceptable to our customers and on a timely basis are significant factors in determining our competitiveness in our target markets. As consumers have new product feature preferences or have different requirements than those consumers in the PC market, PC sales could be negatively impacted, which could adversely impact our business. Our product roadmap includes our next generation AMD Ryzen, AMD Radeon and AMD EPYC processors using 7 nm process technology. We cannot assure you that our efforts to execute our product roadmap will result in innovative products and technologies that provide value to our customers. If we fail to or are delayed in developing, qualifying or shipping new products or technologies that provide value to our customers and address these new trends or if we fail to predict which new form factors consumers will adopt and adjust our business accordingly, we may lose competitive positioning, which could cause us to lose market share and require us to discount the selling prices of our products. Although we make substantial investments in research and development, we cannot be certain that we will be able to develop, obtain or successfully implement new products and technologies on a timely basis or that they will be well-received by our customers. Moreover, our investments in new products and technologies involve certain risks and uncertainties and could disrupt our ongoing business. New investments may not generate sufficient revenue, may incur unanticipated liabilities and may divert our limited resources and distract management from our current operations. We cannot be certain that our ongoing investments in new products and technologies will be successful, will meet our expectations and will not adversely affect our reputation, financial condition and operating results.
research and development
If we cannot generate sufficient revenue and operating cash flow or obtain external financing, we may face a cash shortfall and be unable to make all of our planned investments in research and development or other strategic investments.
research and development
Our ability to fund research and development expenditures depends on generating sufficient revenue and cash flow from operations and the availability of external financing, if necessary. Our research and development expenditures, together with ongoing operating expenses, will be a substantial drain on our cash flow and may decrease our cash balances. If new competitors, technological advances by existing competitors, or other competitive factors require us to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated in our research and development efforts, our operating expenses would increase. If we are required to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated in research and development efforts without an increase in revenue, our operating results could decline.

limit our credit lines. Our inability to obtain needed financing or to generate sufficient cash from operations may require us to abandon projects or curtail planned investments in research and development or other strategic initiatives. If we curtail planned investments in research and development or abandon projects, our products may fail to remain competitive and our business would be materially adversely affected.
research and development
In addition, we are entering markets with current and new competitors who may be able to adapt more quickly to customer requirements and emerging technologies. We cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against current or new competitors who may have stronger positions in these new markets or superior ability to anticipate customer requirements and emerging industry trends. We may face delays or disruptions in research and development efforts, or we may be required to invest significantly greater resources in research and development than anticipated.

As of December 29, 2018, we leased approximately 2.47 million square feet of space for research and development, engineering, administrative and warehouse use, including our headquarters in Santa Clara, California, our principal administrative facilities in Austin, Texas, our main facility with respect to graphics and chipset products located in Markham, Ontario, Canada and a number of smaller regional sales offices located in commercial centers near customers, principally in the United States, Latin America, Europe and Asia. These leases expire at varying dates through 2028, although some of these leases include optional renewals. We occupy 220,000 square feet of space in our headquarters in Santa Clara, California under a 10-year operating lease which commenced in August 2017. We have the option to extend the term of the lease for two additional 5-year periods. The lease for our principal administrative facilities in Austin, Texas expires in March 2025, and provides for one 10-year optional renewal. The leases for our facilities in Markham, Ontario, Canada expire in February 2028, and provide for one 5-year optional renewals.

The most significant impacts of the adoption of ASC 606 to the Company related to: (1) the acceleration of revenue recognition for sales of semi-custom products subject to a non-cancellable customer purchase order, (2) the acceleration of revenue recognition for sales to distributors, and (3) the timing and financial statement classification of certain development and intellectual property licensing agreements. Revenue from sales of semi-custom products under non-cancellable purchases orders, and that have no alternative use to the Company at contract inception, is recognized, based on the value of the semi-custom products and expected margin, over the time of production of the semi-custom products by the Company, rather than upon shipment. Revenue from sales to the Company's distributors is recognized upon shipment of the product to the distributors (sell-in), net of provision for estimated reserves, instead of the previous revenue recognition which was upon the reported resale of the product by the distributors to their customers (sell-through). For a development and IP licensing agreement executed in 2017, the Company recognized IP-related revenue in the third quarter of 2018 for the entire amount of arrangement consideration upon the completion of all the technology milestones. Previously, the agreement resulted in the reduction to research and development expenses in 2017 for development work as the expenses were incurred and would have resulted in licensing revenue to be recognized in periods beyond 2017 upon completion of the deliverables, based on a fair value allocation of the consideration received. Revenue recognition related to the Company’s other revenue streams remain substantially unchanged.
research and development
2017 Research and development expenses increased due to the absence of credits to research and development expenses recognized for a development and intellectual property licensing agreement under the “As reported” standard, the entire amount of consideration was recognized as revenue in 2018 upon transfer of control of the IP license to the customer under the new standard.
research and development
2017 Other current liabilities adjusted primarily due to the absence of credits to research and development expenses recognized for a development and intellectual property licensing agreement under the “As reported” standard, the entire amount of consideration was recognized as revenue in 2018 upon transfer of control of the IP license to the customer under the new standard. The credits are recorded as deferred revenue under the new standard.

2017 Computing and Graphics operating income decreased primarily due to the lower revenue from sales to distributors. In addition, 2017 is lower due to the absence of credits to research and development expenses recognized for a development and intellectual property licensing agreement under the “As Reported” standard, the entire amount of consideration was recognized as revenue in 2018 upon transfer of control of the IP license to the customer under the new standard. 2016 Computing and Graphics operating loss increased due to slightly higher operating expenses.
research and development
2017 Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom operating income decreased primarily due to lower revenue from sales of semi-custom products. In addition, 2017 is lower due to the absence of credits to research and development expenses recognized for a certain development and intellectual property licensing agreement under the “As reported” standard, the entire amount of consideration was recognized as revenue in 2018 upon transfer of control of the IP license to the customer under the new standard. 2016 Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom operating income increased due to higher revenue from sales of semi-custom products.

If GF is not able to satisfy AMD’s manufacturing requirements, AMD's business could be adversely impacted; AMD relies on third parties to manufacture its products, and if they are unable to do so on a timely basis in sufficient quantities and using competitive technologies, AMD’s business could be materially adversely affected; failure to achieve expected manufacturing yields for AMD’s products could negatively impact its financial results; the success of AMD’s business is dependent upon its ability to introduce products on a timely basis with features and performance levels that provide value to its customers while supporting and coinciding with significant industry transitions; if AMD cannot generate sufficient revenue and operating cash flow or obtain external financing, it may face a cash shortfall and be unable to make all of its planned investments in research and development or other strategic investments; the loss of a significant customer may have a material adverse effect on AMD; AMD’s receipt of revenue from its semi-custom SoC products is dependent upon its technology being designed into third-party products and the success of those products; AMD's products may be subject to security vulnerabilities that could have a material adverse effect on AMD; global economic uncertainty may adversely impact AMD’s business and operating results; AMD may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service its debt obligations or meet its working capital requirements; AMD has a large amount of indebtedness which could adversely affect its financial position and prevent it from implementing its strategy or fulfilling its contractual obligations; the agreements governing AMD’s notes and the Secured Revolving Line of Credit impose restrictions on AMD that may adversely affect AMD's ability to operate its business; the markets in which AMD’s products are sold are highly competitive; AMD's issuance to West Coast Hitech L.P. (WCH) of warrants to purchase 75 million shares of its common stock, if and when exercised, will dilute the ownership interests of AMD's existing stockholders, and the conversion of the 2.125% Convertible Senior Notes due 2026 (2.125% Notes) may dilute the ownership interest of AMD's existing stockholders, or may otherwise depress the price of its common stock; uncertainties involving the ordering and shipment of AMD’s products could materially adversely affect it; the demand for AMD’s products depends in part on the market conditions in the industries into which they are sold. Fluctuations in demand for AMD’s products or a market decline in any of these industries could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations; AMD’s ability to design and introduce new products in a timely manner is dependent upon third-party intellectual property; AMD depends on third-party companies for the design, manufacture and supply of motherboards, software and other computer platform components to support its business; if AMD loses Microsoft Corporation’s support for its products or other software vendors do not design and develop software to run on AMD’s products, its ability to sell

Intel has substantially greater financial resources than we do and accordingly spends substantially greater amounts on marketing and research and development than we do. We expect Intel to maintain its market position and to continue to invest heavily in marketing, research and development, new manufacturing facilities and other technology companies. To the extent Intel manufactures a significantly larger portion of its microprocessor products using more advanced process technologies, or introduces competitive new products into the market before we do, we may be more vulnerable to Intel’s aggressive marketing and pricing strategies for microprocessor products.

Our principal competitor in the discrete graphics market is Nvidia. AMD and Nvidia are the two principal companies offering discrete graphics solutions. Other competitors include a number of smaller companies, which may have greater flexibility to address specific market needs, but less financial resources to do so, especially as we believe that the growing complexity of graphics processors and the associated research and development costs represent an increasingly higher barrier to entry in this market.

We focus our research and development activities on improving product performance and enhancing product design. Our main area of focus is on delivering the next generation of CPU and GPU IP, and designing that IP into our SoCs for our next generation of products, with, in each case, improved system performance and performance-per-watt characteristics. For example, we are focusing on improving the battery life of our APU products for notebooks, the power efficiency of our microprocessors for servers and the performance and power efficiency of our discrete GPUs. We are also focusing on delivering a range of low-power integrated platforms to serve key markets, including commercial clients, mobile computing

To the extent Intel manufactures a significantly larger portion of its microprocessor products using more advanced process technologies, or introduces competitive new products into the market before we do, we may be more vulnerable to Intel’s aggressive marketing and pricing strategies for microprocessor products. For example, Intel has introduced microprocessors for low-cost notebooks, similar to products that we offer for low-cost notebooks.

Our success depends to a significant extent on the development, qualification, implementation and acceptance of new product designs and improvements that provide value to our customers. Our ability to develop, qualify and distribute, and have manufactured, new products and related technologies to meet evolving industry requirements, at prices acceptable to our customers and on a timely basis are significant factors in determining our competitiveness in our target markets. For example, a large portion of our Computing and Graphics revenue is focused on consumer desktop PC and notebook. While overall growth in Computing and Graphics is stabilizing, the areas within Computing and Graphics are changing. Our ability to take advantage of the opportunities within the areas of Computing and Graphics is based on foreseeing those changes and making timely investments in the form factors that serve those areas. As consumers adopt new form factors, have new product feature preferences or have different requirements than those consumers in the PC market, PC sales could be negatively impacted, which could adversely impact our business. Our product roadmap includes AMD Ryzen™ and AMD EPYC™ processors based on our new x86 processor core codenamed “Zen” to help drive our re-entry into high-performance and server computing. We cannot assure you that our efforts to execute our product roadmap and address markets beyond our core PC market will result in innovative products and technologies that provide value to our customers. If we fail to or are delayed in developing, qualifying or shipping new products or technologies that provide value to our customers and address these new trends or if we fail to predict which new form factors consumers will adopt and adjust our business accordingly, we may lose competitive positioning, which could cause us to lose market share and require us to discount the selling prices of our products. Although we make substantial investments in research and development, we cannot be certain that we will be able to develop, obtain or successfully implement new products and technologies on a timely basis or that they will be well-received by our customers. Moreover, our investments in new products and technologies involve certain risks and uncertainties and could disrupt our ongoing business. New investments may not generate sufficient revenue, may incur unanticipated liabilities and may divert our limited resources and distract management from our current operations. We cannot be certain that our ongoing investments in new products and technologies will be successful, will meet our expectations and will not adversely affect our reputation, financial condition and operating results.

If we cannot generate sufficient revenue and operating cash flow or obtain external financing, we may face a cash shortfall and be unable to make all of our planned investments in research and development or other strategic investments.
research and development
Our ability to fund research and development expenditures depends on generating sufficient revenue and cash flow from operations and the availability of external financing, if necessary. Our research and development expenditures, together with ongoing operating expenses, will be a substantial drain on our cash flow and may decrease our cash balances. If new competitors, technological advances by existing competitors or other competitive factors require us to invest significantly greater resources
research and development
than anticipated in our research and development efforts, our operating expenses would increase. If we are required to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated in research and development efforts without an increase in revenue, our operating results could decline.
research and development
We regularly assess markets for external financing opportunities, including debt and equity financing. Additional debt or equity financing may not be available when needed or, if available, may not be available on satisfactory terms. The health of the credit markets may adversely impact our ability to obtain financing when needed. Any downgrades from credit rating agencies such as Moody’s or Standard & Poor’s may adversely impact our ability to obtain external financing or the terms of such financing. Credit agency downgrades or concerns regarding our credit worthiness may impact relationships with our suppliers, who may limit our credit lines. Our inability to obtain needed financing or to generate sufficient cash from operations may require us to abandon projects or curtail planned investments in research and development or other strategic initiatives. If we curtail planned investments in research and development or abandon projects, our products may fail to remain competitive and our business would be materially adversely affected.

In addition, we are entering markets with current and new competitors who may be able to adapt more quickly to customer requirements and emerging technologies. We cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against current or new competitors who may have stronger positions in these new markets or superior ability to anticipate customer requirements and emerging industry trends. We may face delays or disruptions in research and development efforts, or we may be required to invest significantly greater resources in research and development than anticipated.

Custom products which are associated with the Company’s Enterprise, Embedded, and Semi-Custom segment (semi-custom products), under non-cancellable purchases orders, which are manufactured to customers’ specifications, and cannot be re-sold to another customer, will be recognized as revenue, based on the value of the inventory and expected margin, over the time of production of the products by the Company, rather than upon shipment. Revenue from sales to the Company's distributors will be recognized as revenue upon shipment of the product to the distributors (sell-in), instead of the current revenue recognition upon reported resale of the product by the distributors to their customers (sell-through). For a development and intellectual property licensing agreement executed in 2017, the Company will recognize revenue for the entire consideration upon transfer of control of the intellectual property (IP) license to the customer in a future period. Previously, the agreement resulted in the reduction to research and development expenses in 2017 for development work as the expenses were incurred and would have resulted in licensing revenue to be recognized in periods beyond 2017 upon completion of the deliverables, based on a fair value allocation of the consideration received. Revenue recognition related to the Company’s other revenue streams will remain substantially unchanged.

Our success depends to a significant extent on the development, qualification, implementation and acceptance of new product designs and improvements that provide value to our customers. Our ability to develop, qualify and distribute, and have manufactured, new products and related technologies to meet evolving industry requirements, at prices acceptable to our customers and on a timely basis are significant factors in determining our competitiveness in our target markets. For example, a large portion of our Computing and Graphics revenue is focused on consumer desktop PC and notebook. While overall growth in Computing and Graphics is stabilizing, the areas within Computing and Graphics are changing. Our ability to take advantage of the opportunities within the areas of Computing and Graphics is based on foreseeing those changes and making timely investments in the form factors that serve those areas. As consumers adopt new form factors, have new product feature preferences or have different requirements than those consumers in the PC market, PC sales could be negatively impacted, which could adversely impact our business. Our product roadmap includes a new x86 processor core codenamed “Zen” to help drive our re-entry into high-performance and server computing. We cannot assure you that our efforts to execute our product roadmap and address markets beyond our core PC market will result in innovative products and technologies that provide value to our customers. If we fail to or are delayed in developing, qualifying or shipping new products or technologies that provide value to our customers and address these new trends or if we fail to predict which new form factors consumers will adopt and adjust our business accordingly, we may lose competitive positioning, which could cause us to lose market share and require us to discount the selling prices of our products. Although we make substantial investments in research and development, we cannot be certain that we will be able to develop, obtain or successfully implement new products and technologies on a timely basis or that they will be well-received by our customers. Moreover, our investments in new products and technologies involve certain risks and uncertainties and could disrupt our ongoing business. New investments may not generate sufficient revenue, may incur unanticipated liabilities and may divert our limited resources and distract management from our current operations. We cannot be certain that our ongoing investments in new products and technologies will be successful, will meet our expectations and will not adversely affect our reputation, financial condition and operating results.

Our ability to fund research and development expenditures depends on generating sufficient revenue and cash flow from operations and the availability of external financing, if necessary. Our research and development expenditures, together with ongoing operating expenses, will be a substantial drain on our cash flow and may decrease our cash balances. If new competitors, technological advances by existing competitors or other competitive factors require us to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated in our research and development efforts, our operating expenses would increase. If we are required to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated in research and development efforts without an increase in revenue, our operating results could decline.

We regularly assess markets for external financing opportunities, including debt and equity financing. Additional debt or equity financing may not be available when needed or, if available, may not be available on satisfactory terms. The health of the credit markets may adversely impact our ability to obtain financing when needed. Any downgrades from credit rating agencies such as Moody’s or Standard & Poor’s may adversely impact our ability to obtain external financing or the terms of such financing. Credit agency downgrades or concerns regarding our credit worthiness may impact relationships with our suppliers, who may limit our credit lines. Our inability to obtain needed financing or to generate sufficient cash from operations may require us to abandon projects or curtail planned investments in research and development or other strategic initiatives. If we curtail planned investments in research and development or abandon projects, our products may fail to remain competitive and our business would be materially adversely affected.

As of December 31, 2016, we leased approximately 2.23 million square feet of space for research and development, engineering, administrative and warehouse use, including our headquarters in Sunnyvale, California, our principal administrative facilities in Austin, Texas, our main facility with respect to graphics and chipset products located in Markham, Ontario, Canada and a number of smaller regional sales offices located in commercial centers near customers, principally in the United States, Latin America, Europe and Asia. These leases expire at varying dates through 2028, although some of these leases include optional renewals. During the second quarter of 2016, we signed an amendment to the lease agreement associated with our headquarters in Sunnyvale, California so that the lease expires a year earlier, in December 2017. During the third quarter of 2016, we entered into a 10-year operating lease to occupy 220,156 square feet of new office space in Santa Clara, California. We estimate this lease to commence in August 2017. We have the option to extend the term of the lease for two additional 5-year periods. The lease for our principal administrative facilities in Austin, Texas expires in March 2025, and provides for one 10-year optional renewal. The lease for our facilities in Markham, Ontario, Canada expires in February 2028, and provides for one 5-year optional renewal.
r&d
Gross margin, as a percentage of net revenue for 2016, was 23% compared to 27% in 2015. The decrease in gross margin in 2016 as compared to 2015 was primarily due to a $340 million charge taken in the third quarter of 2016 (the WSA Charge) related to the sixth amendment to the wafer supply agreement (the Sixth Amendment) with GLOBALFOUNDRIES Inc. (GF). Operating loss for 2016 was $372 million compared to a $481 million for 2015. This improvement in operating performance in 2016 compared to 2015 was due to an increase in net revenue described above, a reduction in restructuring and other special charges, net and a licensing gain related to an intellectual property license agreement in connection with the joint ventures in China that we formed with Tianjin Haiguang Advanced Technology Investment Co. Ltd. (THATIC), partially offset by an increase in cost of sales due to the WSA Charge. During 2016, we continued to closely manage our operating expenses. Our operating expenses in 2016 decreased to $1.5 billion, compared to $1.6 billion in 2015, due to the absence of restructuring charges in 2016, partially offset by increased R&D expenses.

The decrease was partially offset by a $16 million increase in research and development expenses attributable to our Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment. Research and development expenses attributable to our Computing and Graphics segment decreased primarily due to a $116 million decrease in product engineering and design costs and a $4 million decrease in other employee compensation and benefit expenses. Research and development expenses attributable to our Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment increased primarily due to a $17 million increase in product engineering and design costs.

Intel has substantially greater financial resources than we do and accordingly spends substantially greater amounts on marketing and research and development than we do. We expect Intel to maintain its market position and to continue to invest heavily in marketing, research and development, new manufacturing facilities and other technology companies. To the extent Intel manufactures a significantly larger portion of its microprocessor products using more advanced process technologies, or introduces competitive new products into the market before we do, we may be more vulnerable to Intel’s aggressive marketing and pricing strategies for microprocessor products. For example, Intel has introduced microprocessors for low-cost notebooks, similar to products that we offer for low-cost notebooks.

Our principal competitor in the graphics market is Nvidia. AMD and Nvidia are the two principal players offering discrete graphics solutions. Other competitors include a number of smaller companies, which may have greater flexibility to address specific market needs, but less financial resources to do so, especially as we believe that the growing complexity of graphics processors and the associated research and development costs represent an increasingly higher barrier to entry in this market. In the semi-custom game console products, where graphics performance is critical, we compete primarily against Nvidia, and also compete against Imagination Technology Group.

We focus our research and development activities on improving product performance and enhancing product design. Our main area of focus is on delivering the next generation of CPU and GPU IP, and designing that IP into our SoCs for our next generation of products,with, in each case, improved system performance and performance-per-watt characteristics. For example, we are focusing on improving the battery life of our microprocessors and APU products for notebooks and the power efficiency of our microprocessors for servers. We are also focusing on delivering a range of low-power integrated platforms to serve key markets, including commercial clients, mobile computing and gaming and media computing. We believe that these platforms will bring customers increased performance and energy efficiency. We also work with industry leaders on process technology, software and other functional intellectual property and we work with others in the industry and industry consortia to conduct early stage research and development.

Our success depends to a significant extent on the development, qualification, implementation and acceptance of new product designs and improvements that provide value to our customers. Our ability to develop, qualify and distribute, and have manufactured, new products and related technologies to meet evolving industry requirements, at prices acceptable to our customers and on a timely basis are significant factors in determining our competitiveness in our target markets. For example, a large portion of our Computing and Graphics revenue is focused on consumer desktop PC and notebook segments, which have experienced and continue to experience a decline driven by, among other factors, the adoption of smaller form factors, increased competition and changes in replacement cycles. As consumers adopt new form factors, have new product feature preferences or have different requirements than those consumers in the PC market, PC sales could be negatively impacted, which could adversely impact our business. Our product roadmap includes a new x86 processor core codenamed “Zen” to help drive our re-entry into high-performance and server computing. We cannot assure you that our efforts to execute our product roadmap and address markets beyond our core PC market will result in innovative products and technologies that provide value to our customers. If we fail to or are delayed in developing, qualifying or shipping new products or technologies that provide value to our customers and address these new trends or if we fail to predict which new form factors consumers will adopt and adjust our business accordingly, we may lose competitive positioning, which could cause us to lose market share and require us to discount the selling prices of our products. Although we make substantial investments in research and development, we cannot be certain that we will be able to develop, obtain or successfully implement new products and technologies on a timely basis.
research and development
If we cannot generate sufficient revenue and operating cash flow or obtain external financing, we may face a cash shortfall and be unable to make all of our planned investments in research and development or other strategic investments.
research and development
Our ability to fund research and development expenditures depends on generating sufficient revenue and cash flow from operations and the availability of external financing, if necessary. Our research and development expenditures, together with ongoing operating expenses, will be a substantial drain on our cash flow and may decrease our cash balances. If new competitors, technological advances by existing competitors or other competitive factors require us to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated in our research and development efforts, our operating expenses would increase. If we are required to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated in research and development efforts without an increase in revenue, our operating results could decline.
research and development
Credit agency downgrades or concerns regarding our credit worthiness may impact relationships with our suppliers, who may limit our credit lines. Our inability to obtain needed financing or to generate sufficient cash from operations may require us to abandon projects or curtail planned investments in research and development or other strategic initiatives. If we curtail planned investments in research and development or abandon projects, our products may fail to remain competitive and our business would be materially adversely affected.
research and development
In addition, we are entering markets with current and new competitors who may be able to adapt more quickly to customer requirements and emerging technologies. We cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against current or new competitors who may have stronger positions in these new markets or superior ability to anticipate customer requirements and emerging industry trends. We may face delays or disruptions in research and development efforts, or we may be required to significantly invest greater resources in research and development than anticipated.

We focus our research and development activities on improving and enhancing product design. One main area of focus is on delivering the next generation of products with greater system level integration of the CPU and GPU and transforming our products into SoCs, with, in each case, improved system performance and performance-per-watt characteristics. For example, we are focusing on improving the battery life of our microprocessors and APU products for notebooks and the power efficiency of our microprocessors for servers. We are also focusing on delivering a range of low-power integrated platforms to serve key markets, including commercial clients, mobile computing and gaming and media computing, as well as developing an HSA, which is designed for software developers to easily program APUs by combining scalar processing on the CPU with parallel processing on the GPU, all while providing high bandwidth access to memory at low power. We believe that these integrated platforms will bring customers better time-to-market and increased performance and energy efficiency. We also work with industry leaders on process technology, software and other functional intellectual property and we work with others in the industry, public foundations, universities and industry consortia to conduct early stage research and development.

If new competitors, technological advances by existing competitors or other competitive factors require us to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated in our research and development efforts, our operating expenses would increase. If we are required to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated in research and development efforts without an increase in revenue, our operating results could decline.

We regularly assess markets for external financing opportunities, including debt and equity financing. Additional debt or equity financing may not be available when needed or, if available, may not be available on satisfactory terms. The health of the credit markets may adversely impact our ability to obtain financing when needed. Any downgrades from credit rating agencies such as Moodys or Standard & Poors may adversely impact our ability to obtain external financing or the terms of such financing. In addition, credit agency downgrades or concerns regarding our credit worthiness may impact relationships with our suppliers, who may limit our credit lines. Our inability to obtain needed financing or to generate sufficient cash from operations may require us to abandon projects or curtail planned investments in research and development or other strategic initiatives. If we curtail planned investments in research and development or abandon projects, our products may fail to remain competitive and our business would be materially adversely affected.

Moreover, our business strategy is dependent on creating products that anticipate customer requirements and emerging industry trends. For example, throughout 2014, we sampled Seattle, our first 64-bit ARM server processor and in the second quarter of 2014, we announced a 64-bit ARM architectural license for the development of custom high-performance cores for high-growth adjacent markets. Also in the second quarter of 2014 we announced our third generation mainstream and low powered mobile APUs, formerly codenamed Mullins and Beema, and we released our new embedded APU, formerly codenamed Bald Eagle, which is our first embedded processor to incorporate HSA features. We cannot assure you that our new strategic direction, including our efforts to address markets beyond our core PC market and our efforts to create ARM-based products, will result in innovative products and technologies that provide value to our customers. In addition, we may be entering markets where current and new competitors may be able to adapt more quickly to customer requirements and emerging technologies. We cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against current or new competitors who may have stronger positions in these new markets. We may face delays or disruptions in research and development efforts, or we may be required to significantly invest greater resources in research and development than anticipated.

Research and Development Expenses
research and development
Research and development expenses of $1.1 billion in 2014 decreased by $129 million, or 11%, compared to $1.2 billion in 2013. The decrease was primarily due to a $201 million decrease in research and development expenses attributable to our Computing and Graphics segment, partially offset by a $64 million increase in research and development expenses attributable to our Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment and a $9 million increase in the All Other category related to a workforce rebalancing severance charge recorded in the first quarter of 2014. Research and development expenses attributable to our Computing and Graphics segment decreased primarily due to a $171 million decrease in product engineering and design costs, a $22 million decrease in other employee compensation and benefit expenses and a $10 million decrease in manufacturing process technology expenses. Research and development expenses attributable to our Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment, where we expect to continue to increase our investment, increased primarily due to a $59 million increase in product engineering and design costs and a $3 million increase in other employee compensation and benefit expenses.
research and development
Research and development expenses of $1.2 billion in 2013 decreased by $153 million, or 11%, compared to $1.4 billion in 2012. The decrease was primarily due to a $112 million decrease in research and development expense attributable to our Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment, a $37 million decrease in research and development expenses attributable to our Computing and Graphics segment and a $4 million decrease in stock-based compensation expense recorded in the All Other category. Research and development expenses attributable to our Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment decreased as a result of a $103 million decrease in product engineering costs and a $9 million decrease in manufacturing process technology expenses. The decrease in research and development expenses attributable to our Computing and Graphics segment was primarily due to a $38 million decrease in product engineering costs and a $35 million decrease in manufacturing process technology expenses, partially offset by a $34 million increase in other employee compensation and benefit expenses.

Material factors and assumptions that were applied in making these forward-looking statements include, without limitation, the following: the expected rate of market growth and demand for our products and technologies (and the mix thereof); GFs manufacturing yields and wafer volumes; our expected market share; our expected product costs and average selling price; our overall competitive position and the competitiveness of our current and future products; our ability to introduce new products, consistent with our current roadmap; our ability to make additional investment in research and development and that such opportunities will be available; the expected demand for computers; and the state of credit markets and macroeconomic conditions. Material factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from current expectations include, without limitation, the following: that Intel Corporations pricing, marketing and rebating programs, product bundling, standard setting, new product introductions or other activities may negatively impact our plans; that we will require additional funding and may be unable to raise sufficient capital on favorable terms, or at all; that customers stop buying our products or materially reduce their operations or demand for our products; that we may be unable to develop, launch and ramp new products and technologies in the volumes that are required by the market at mature yields on a timely basis; that our third-party foundry suppliers will be unable to transition our products to advanced manufacturing process technologies in a timely and effective way or to manufacture our products on a timely basis in sufficient quantities and using competitive process technologies; that we will be unable to obtain sufficient manufacturing capacity or components to meet demand for our products or will not fully utilize our projected manufacturing capacity needs at GFs microprocessor manufacturing facilities; that our requirements for wafers will be less than the fixed number of wafers that we agreed to purchase from GF or GF encounters problems that significantly reduce the number of functional die we receive from each wafer; that we are unable to successfully implement our long-term business strategy; that we inaccurately estimate the quantity or type of products that our customers will want in the future or will ultimately end up purchasing, resulting in excess or obsolete inventory; that we are unable to manage the risks related to the use of our third-party distributors and add-in-board (AIB) partners or offer the appropriate incentives to focus them on the sale of our products; that we may be unable to maintain the level of investment in research and development that is required to remain competitive; that there may be unexpected variations in
research and development
Intel has substantially greater financial resources than we do and accordingly spends substantially greater amounts on marketing and research and development than we do. We expect Intel to maintain its dominant position and to continue to invest heavily in marketing, research and development, new manufacturing facilities and other technology companies. To the extent Intel manufactures a significantly larger portion of its microprocessor products using more advanced process technologies, or introduces competitive new products into the market before we do, we may be more vulnerable to Intels aggressive marketing and pricing strategies for microprocessor products. For example, Intel recently introduced microprocessors for low-cost notebooks, similar to products that we offer for low-cost notebooks.
development cost
Other than Intel, our principal competitor in the graphics and visual solutions market is Nvidia. AMD and Nvidia are the two principal players offering discrete graphics solutions. Other competitors include a number of smaller companies, which may have greater flexibility to address specific market needs, but less financial resources to do so, especially as we believe that the growing complexity of visual processors and the associated research and development costs represent an increasingly higher barrier to entry in this market.

We focus our research and development activities on improving and enhancing product design. One main area of focus is on delivering the next generation of products with greater system level integration of the CPU and GPU and transforming our products into SOCs, with, in each case, improved system performance and performance-per-watt characteristics. For example, we are focusing on improving the battery life of our microprocessors and APU products for notebooks and tablets and the power efficiency of our microprocessors for servers. We are also focusing on delivering a range of low-power integrated platforms to serve key markets, including commercial clients, mobile computing and gaming and media computing, as well as developing an HSA, which is designed for software developers to easily program APUs by combining scalar processing on the CPU with parallel processing on the GPU, all while providing high bandwidth access to memory at low power. We believe that these integrated platforms will bring customers better time-to-market and increased performance and energy efficiency. We also work with industry leaders on process technology, software and other functional intellectual property and we work with others in the industry, public foundations, universities and industry consortia to conduct early stage research and development.
research and development
Our research and development expenses for 2013, 2012 and 2011 were approximately $1.2 billion, $1.4 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively. For more information, see Part II, Item 7-Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, or MD&A.
research and development
We conduct product and system research and development activities for our products in the United States with additional design and development engineering teams located in China, Canada, India, Singapore, Taiwan and Israel.
research and development
Our success depends to a significant extent on the development, qualification, implementation and acceptance of new product designs and improvements that provide value to our customers. Our ability to develop, qualify and distribute, and have manufactured, new products and related technologies to meet evolving industry requirements, at prices acceptable to our customers and on a timely basis are significant factors in determining our competitiveness in our target markets. For example, form factors have increasingly shifted from desktop PCs and notebooks to tablets, and tablets have been one of the fastest growing form factors. Historically, a significant portion of our Computing Solutions revenue has been related to desktop PCs. Currently, a significant portion of our business is focused on the consumer PC portions of the market, and we believe that PC market conditions will remain challenging. As consumers adopt new form factors and have different requirements than those consumers in the PC market, PC sales could be negatively impacted, which could negatively impact our business. If we fail to or are delayed in developing, qualifying or shipping new products or technologies that provide value to our customers and address these new trends or if we fail to predict which new form factors consumers will adopt, we may lose competitive positioning, which could cause us to lose market share and require us to discount the selling prices of our products. Although we make substantial investments in research and development, we cannot be certain that we will be able to develop, obtain or successfully implement new products and technologies on a timely basis.
research and development
If we cannot generate sufficient revenues and operating cash flow or obtain external financing, we may face a cash shortfall and be unable to make all of our planned investments in research and development or other strategic investments.
research and development
Our ability to fund research and development expenditures depends on generating sufficient cash flow from operations and the availability of external financing, if necessary. Our research and development expenditures, together with ongoing operating expenses, will be a substantial drain on our cash flow and may decrease our cash balances. If new competitors, technological advances by existing competitors or other competitive factors require us to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated in our research and development efforts, our operating expenses would increase. If we are required to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated in research and development efforts without an increase in revenue, our operating results could decline.
research and development
We regularly assess markets for external financing opportunities, including debt and equity financing. Additional debt or equity financing may not be available when needed or, if available, may not be available on satisfactory terms. The health of the credit markets may adversely impact our ability to obtain financing when needed. Any downgrades from credit rating agencies such as Moodys or Standard & Poors may adversely impact our ability to obtain external financing or the terms of such financing. In addition, credit agency downgrades or concerns regarding our credit worthiness may impact relationships with our suppliers, who may limit our credit lines. For example, in the first quarter of 2013, Moodys lowered our senior unsecured debt rating to B2 from B1 and Standard & Poor lowered our senior unsecured debt rating to B from BB. Our inability to obtain needed financing or to generate sufficient cash from operations may require us to abandon projects or curtail planned investments in research and development or other strategic initiatives. If we curtail planned investments in research and development or abandon projects, our products may fail to remain competitive and our business would be materially adversely affected.
research and development
Moreover, our business strategy is dependent on creating products that anticipate customer requirements and emerging industry trends. We cannot assure you that our new strategic direction will result in innovative products and technologies that provide value to our customers. In addition, we may be entering markets where current and new competitors may be able to adapt more quickly to customer requirements and emerging technologies. We cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against current or new competitors who may have stronger positions in these new markets. We may face delays or disruptions in research and development efforts, or we may be required to significantly invest greater resources in research and development than anticipated.

The developed technology of SeaMicro relates to SeaMicros SM10000 server offerings, which is built around a parallel array of independent ultra-low power processors, and it serves to integrate computation, switching, server management and load balancing. In addition to developed technology, SeaMicro had in-process research and development projects, which were incomplete at the time of the acquisition. The value of developed technology and in-process research and development was determined based on the present value of estimated expected cash flows attributable to the technology. The customer relationships related to the ability to sell existing, in-process and future versions of the technology to SeaMicros existing customers and were valued based on incremental cash flows generated from the existing customer base. The trade name related to the SeaMicro brand names. The goodwill was primarily attributed to premiums paid for synergies between the Company and SeaMicro and the assembled workforce and is not deductible for tax purposes. The acquired developed technology, customer relationships and trade name are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. The acquired in-process research and development and goodwill associated with the acquisition are categorized as indefinite-lived intangible assets and subject to impairment review. Capitalized acquired in-process research and development costs will remain capitalized until such time as the projects are complete, at which point they will be amortized, or they will be written off when it is probable the projects will not be completed. As of December 28, 2013, approximately $5 million of in-process research and development projects were completed and classified as developed technology, and the Company started to amortize these projects on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives.

Our ability to develop, qualify and distribute new products and related technologies to meet evolving industry requirements, at prices acceptable to our customers and on a timely basis are significant factors in determining our competitiveness in our target markets. For example, form factors have increasingly shifted from desktop PCs to mobile PCs, and tablets have been one of the fastest growing form factors. Also, ARM-based processors are being used in mobile and embedded electronics products as relatively low cost and small microprocessors and also in form factors such as laptops, tablets and smartphones. Historically, a significant portion of our Computing Solutions revenue has been related to desktop PCs. Currently, approximately 85% of our business is focused on the legacy PC portions of the market, projected to have slowing growth over the next several years. To the extent consumers adopt new form factors and have different requirements than those consumers in the PC market, PC sales could be negatively impacted, which could negatively impact our business. If we fail to or are delayed in developing, qualifying or shipping new products or technologies that provide value to our customers and address these new trends, we may lose competitive positioning, which could cause us to lose market share and require us to discount the selling prices of our products. Although we make substantial investments in research and development, we cannot be certain that we will be able to develop, obtain or successfully implement new products and technologies on a timely basis.
research and development
If we cannot generate sufficient revenues and operating cash flow or obtain external financing, we may face a cash shortfall and be unable to make all of our planned investments in research and development or other strategic investments.
research and development
Our ability to fund research and development expenditures depends on generating sufficient cash flow from operations and the availability of external financing, if necessary. Our research and development expenditures, together with ongoing operating expenses, will be a substantial drain on our cash flow and may decrease our cash balances. If new competitors, technological advances by existing competitors or other competitive factors require us to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated in our research and development efforts, our operating expenses would increase. If we are required to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated in research and development efforts without an increase in revenue, our operating results could decline.
research and development
We believe that the challenging macroeconomic conditions that we experienced in the second half of 2012 will continue during the first half of 2013. We regularly assess markets for external financing opportunities, including debt and equity financing. Additional debt or equity financing may not be available when needed or, if available, may not be available on satisfactory terms. The health of the credit markets may adversely impact our ability to obtain financing when needed. In addition, any downgrades from credit rating agencies such as Moodys or Standard & Poors may adversely impact our ability to obtain external financing or the terms of such financing. Credit agency downgrades may also impact relationships with our suppliers, who may limit our credit lines. For example, in the first quarter of 2013 Moodys lowered our corporate family rating to B2 from B1, and the ratings on our senior unsecured notes to B2 from B1. Furthermore, in the first quarter of 2013, Standard & Poor lowered our corporate credit and senior unsecured rating from B to BB. Our inability to obtain needed financing or to generate sufficient cash from operations may require us to abandon projects or curtail planned investments in research and development or other strategic initiatives. If we curtail planned investments in research and development or abandon projects, our products may fail to remain competitive and our business would be materially adversely affected.
research and development
We are implementing a long-term business strategy to refocus our business to address markets beyond our core, PC market to the faster growing low power or dense server, embedded, and ultraportable and ultra-low-power markets. Currently, approximately 85% of our business is focused on the legacy PC portions of the market, projected to have slowing growth over the next several years. The goal of our long-term strategy is to drive 40% to 50% of our portfolio to faster growth markets in the long term. Despite our efforts, we may not be able to implement our strategy in a timely manner to exploit potential market opportunities or meet competitive challenges. Moreover, our business strategy is dependent on creating products that anticipate customer requirements and emerging industry trends. There can be no assurances that our new strategic direction will result in innovative products and technologies that provide value to our customers. In addition, we may be entering markets where current and new competitors may be able to adapt more quickly to customer requirements and emerging technologies. We cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against current or new competitors who may have stronger positions in these new markets. We may face delays or disruptions in research and development efforts, or we may be required to significantly invest greater resources in research and development than anticipated.

Computing Solutions operating loss was $231 million in 2012 compared to operating income of $556 million in 2011. The decline in operating results was primarily due to the decrease in revenue referenced above, partially offset by a $136 million decrease in marketing, general and administrative expenses, a $45 million decrease in research and development expenses and a $29 million decrease in cost of sales. Cost of sales decreased primarily due to lower unit shipments, partially offset by the $273 million LCM charge related to the fee for GFs waiver of a portion of our obligations and an inventory write-down of $100 million during the third quarter of 2012 as a result of lower than anticipated future demand for certain products, mainly first generation A-Series APU products, codenamed Llano. Marketing, general and administrative expenses and research and development expenses decreased for the reasons set forth under Expenses, below.
research and development
Computing Solutions operating income was $556 million in 2011 compared to $529 million in 2010. The improvement in operating results was primarily due to the increase in net revenue referenced above, partially offset by a $70 million increase in cost of sales, a $45 million increase in research and development expenses and a $42 million increase in marketing, general and administrative expenses. Cost of sales increased primarily due to higher microprocessor and chipsets unit shipments and the absence of a one-time benefit related to the deconsolidation of GF in 2010. Research and development expenses and marketing, general and administrative expenses increased for the reasons set forth under Expenses, below.
research and development
Graphics operating income was $105 million in 2012 compared to $51 million in 2011. The improvement in operating results was primarily due to a $101 million decrease in cost of sales, a $60 million decrease in research and development expenses and a $41 million decrease in marketing, general and administrative expenses partially offset by the decrease in net revenue referenced above. Cost of sales decreased primarily due to lower GPU shipments and correspondingly lower manufacturing costs. Marketing, general and administrative expenses and research and development expenses decreased for the reasons set forth under Expenses below.

Research and Development Expenses
research and development
Research and development expenses of $1.4 billion in 2012, decreased by $99 million, or 7%, compared to $1.5 billion in 2011. The decrease was due to a $60 million decrease in research and development expenses attributable to our Graphics segment and a $45 million decrease in research and development expenses attributable to our Computing Solutions segment, partially offset by a $6 million increase in stock-based compensation expense recorded in the All Other category. Research and development expenses attributable to our Graphics segment decreased as a result of a $36 million decrease in product engineering and design costs, a $16 million decrease in other employee compensation and benefit expense and a $9 million decrease in manufacturing process technology expenses. The decrease in research and development expenses attributable to our Computing Solutions segment was primarily due to a $26 million decrease in other employee compensation and benefit expense, an $11 million decrease in manufacturing process technology expenses related to GF for our future products and a $9 million decrease in product engineering and design costs.
research and development
Research and development expenses of $1.5 billion in 2011, increased by $48 million, or 3%, compared to $1.4 billion in 2010. The increase was primarily due to a $45 million increase in research and development expenses attributable to our Computing Solutions segment as a result of a $79 million increase in product engineering and design costs for our future products, partially offset by a $27 million decrease in other employee compensation and benefit expense and a $7 million decrease in manufacturing process technology expenses related to GF for our future products.
research and development
The income tax provision in 2010 was primarily due to withholding taxes paid to the Korean tax authorities in connection with the payment we received from Samsung in December 2010 pursuant to the Patent License and Settlement Agreement as well as foreign taxes in profitable locations offset by benefits, including the monetization of U.S. research and development credits, an alternative minimum tax refund on net operating loss carryback in the United States and the reversal of unrecognized tax benefits in foreign jurisdictions.
research and development
Net cash provided by financing activities was $37 million in 2012 primarily due to net proceeds from the issuance of our 7.50% Notes of $491 million, $23 million from foreign grants from the Canadian government for research and development activities related to our AMD APU products and from the Malaysian and Chinese governments for our local microprocessor assembly, test and packaging facilities and $14 million from the issuance of common stock under our stock-based compensation plan, partially offset by our repayment of outstanding principal and accrued interest on our 5.75% Notes and repayment of capital lease obligations of $489 million.
research and development
Net cash used in financing activities was $6 million in 2011 as a result of payments of $202 million to repurchase $200 million aggregate principal amount of our 6.00% Notes. This amount was partially offset by $170 million of proceeds from our former financing arrangement with the IBM Parties, $20 million in proceeds from foreign grants from the Canadian government for research and development activities related to our AMD APU products and from the Malaysian and Chinese governments for our local microprocessor assembly, test and packaging facilities, and $18 million from the issuance of common stock under our stock-based compensation plan.
research and development
Net cash provided by financing activities was $484 million in 2010 primarily as a result of proceeds of $988 million from our former financing arrangement with the IBM Parties, $490 million from the sale and issuance of $500 million aggregate principal amount of the 7.75% Notes, $19 million in proceeds from foreign grants from the Canadian government for research and development activities related to our Fusion products and from the Malaysian and Chinese governments for our local microprocessor assembly, test and packaging facilities and $15 million from the issuance of common stock under our stock-based compensation plan. These amounts were partially offset by payments of $1,011 million to repurchase $1,016 million aggregate principal amount of our 6.00% Notes.

The developed technology of SeaMicro relates to SeaMicros SM10000 server offerings, which is built around a parallel array of independent ultra-low power processors, and it serves to integrate computation, switching, server management, and load balancing. In addition to developed technology, SeaMicro had in-process research and development projects, which were incomplete at the time of the acquisition. The value of developed technology and in-process research and development was determined based on the present value of estimated expected cash flows attributable to the technology. The customer relationships related to the ability to sell existing, in-process and future versions of the technology to SeaMicros existing customers and were valued based on incremental cash flows generated from the existing customer base. The trade name related to the SeaMicro brand names. The goodwill was primarily attributed to premiums paid for synergies between AMD and SeaMicro and the assembled workforce and is not deductible for tax purposes. The acquired developed technology, customer relationships and trade name are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. The acquired in-process research and development and goodwill associated with the acquisition are categorized as indefinite-lived intangible assets and subject to impairment review. Capitalized acquired in-process research and development costs will remain capitalized until such time as the projects are complete, at which point they will be amortized, or they will be written off when it is probable the projects will not be completed. As of December 29, 2012, approximately $5 million of in-process research and development projects were completed and classified as developed technology, and the Company started to amortize these projects on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives.

increases in deferred tax assets related to the net operating losses generated from pre-tax book losses net of the benefit relating to the SeaMicro acquisition. Purchase accounting for the SeaMicro acquisition required the establishment of a deferred tax liability related to the book tax basis differences of identifiable intangible assets that increased goodwill. The deferred tax liability created an additional source of U.S. future taxable income which resulted in a release of a portion of the Companys U.S. valuation allowance. In 2011, the net valuation allowance decreased by $245 million primarily for decreases in deferred tax assets related to the utilization of net operating losses due to pre-tax book income and a change in the book to tax basis in investments. In 2010, the net valuation allowance decreased by $56 million primarily for decreases in deferred tax assets related to the utilization of net operating losses due to pre-tax book income and the utilization of foreign research and development credits to offset prior period audit adjustments, net of an increase in U.S. deferred tax assets, primarily for foreign tax credits arising from withholding taxes.

Intel has substantially greater financial resources than we do and accordingly spends substantially greater amounts on research and development than we do. We expect Intel to maintain its dominant position and to continue to invest heavily in marketing, research and development, new manufacturing facilities and other technology companies. To the extent Intel manufactures a significantly larger portion of its microprocessor products using more advanced process technologies, or introduces competitive new products into the market before we do, we may be more vulnerable to Intels aggressive marketing and pricing strategies for microprocessor products.
development cost
Other than Intel, our principal competitor in the graphics market is Nvidia. AMD and Nvidia are the two principal players offering discrete graphics solutions. Other competitors include a number of smaller companies, which may have greater flexibility to address specific market needs, but less financial resources to do so, especially as we believe that the growing complexity of visual processors and the associated research and development costs represent an increasingly higher barrier to entry in this market.

We focus our research and development activities on improving and enhancing product design. One main area of focus is on delivering the next generation of products with greater system level integration of the CPU and GPU, improved system performance and performance-per-watt characteristics. For example, we are focusing on improving the battery life of our microprocessors and APU products for mobile PCs and the power efficiency of our microprocessors for servers. We are also focusing on delivering a range of low power integrated platforms to serve key markets, including commercial clients, mobile computing, and gaming and media computing, as well as developing a Heterogeneous System Architecture, which is designed for software developers to easily program APUs by combining scalar processing on the CPU with parallel processing on the GPU, all while providing high bandwidth access to memory at low power. We believe that these integrated platforms will bring customers better time-to-market and increased performance and energy efficiency. We also work with industry leaders on process technology, software and other functional intellectual property and we work with others in the industry, public foundations, universities and industry consortia to conduct early stage research and development.

Intel has substantially greater financial resources than we do and accordingly spends substantially greater amounts on research and development than we do. We expect Intel to maintain its dominant position and to continue to invest heavily in marketing, research and development, new manufacturing facilities and other technology companies. To the extent Intel manufactures a significantly larger portion of its microprocessor products using more advanced process technologies, or introduces competitive new products into the market before we do, we may be more vulnerable to Intels aggressive marketing and pricing strategies for microprocessor products. Intel also leverages its dominance in the microprocessor market to sell its integrated chipsets. Intel manufactures and sells integrated graphics chipsets bundled with their microprocessors and is a dominant competitor with respect to this portion of our business. The continued improvement of the quality of Intels integrated graphics, along with higher unit shipments of our APU products, may drive computer manufacturers to reduce the number of systems they build paired with discrete graphics components, particularly for mobile PCs, because they may offer satisfactory graphics performance for most mainstream PC users, at a lower cost. Intel could also take actions that place our discrete GPUs at a competitive disadvantage, including giving one or more of our competitors in the graphics market, such as Nvidia Corporation, preferential access to its proprietary graphics interface or other useful information.

Computing Solutions operating income was $556 million in 2011 compared to $529 million in 2010. The improvement in operating results was primarily due to the increase in net revenue referenced above, partially offset by a $70 million increase in cost of sales, a $45 million increase in research and development expenses and a $42 million increase in marketing, general and administrative expenses. Cost of sales increased primarily due to higher microprocessor and chipsets unit shipments and the absence of a one-time benefit related to the deconsolidation of GF in 2010. Research and development expenses and marketing, general and administrative expenses increased for the reasons set forth under Expenses, below.
research and development
Computing Solutions operating income was $529 million in 2010 compared to $142 million in 2009. The improvement was primarily due to the increase in net revenue referenced above and a $25 million decrease in cost of sales, partially offset by a $224 million increase in research and development expenses and a $61 million increase in marketing, general and administrative expenses. Cost of sales decreased due to reductions in manufacturing costs and a one-time benefit related to the deconsolidation of GF in 2010. Research and development expenses and marketing, general and administrative expenses increased for the reasons set forth under Expenses, below.

Research and Development Expenses
research and development
Research and development expenses of $1.5 billion in 2011, increased by $48 million, or 3%, compared to $1.4 billion in 2010. The increase was primarily due to a $45 million increase in research and development expenses attributable to our Computing Solutions segment as a result of a $79 million increase in product engineering and design costs for our future products, partially offset by a $27 million decrease in other employee compensation and benefit expense and a $7 million decrease in manufacturing process technology expenses related to GF for our future products.
research and development
Research and development expenses of $1.4 billion in 2010, decreased by $316 million, or 18%, compared to $1.7 billion in 2009. In 2009, research and development expenses included $524 million in research and development expenses related to the Foundry segment. Without taking into account the research and development expenses attributable to the Foundry segment, which are not indicative of our ongoing performance, research and development expenses would have increased by $208 million in 2010 as compared to 2009. This increase was due to a $224 million increase in research and development expenses attributable to our Computing Solutions segment and a $22 million increase in research and development expenses attributable to our Graphics segment, partially offset by a $38 million decrease in research and development expenses attributable to our All Other category. The increase in research and development expenses attributable to our Computing Solutions segment was primarily due to a $91 million increase in product engineering and design costs for our future products, a $68 million increase in employee compensation and benefit expense and a $64 million increase in manufacturing process technology expenses related to GF for our future products. The increase in research and development expenses attributable to our Graphics segment was primarily due to a $33 million increase in employee compensation and benefit expense, partially offset by a $13 million decrease in product engineering and design costs due to lower material costs used in 2010. The decrease in research and development expenses attributable to our All Other category was primarily due to lower research and development expenses related to handheld products because we no longer develop these products.
research and development
The income tax provision in 2010 was primarily due to withholding taxes paid to the Korean tax authorities in connection with the payment we received from Samsung in December 2010 pursuant to the Patent License and Settlement Agreement as well as foreign taxes in profitable locations offset by benefits, including the monetization of U.S. research and development credits, an alternative minimum tax refund on net operating loss carryback in the United States and the reversal of unrecognized tax benefits in foreign jurisdictions.
research and development
The income tax provision in 2009 was primarily due to a one-time loss of deferred tax assets for German net operating loss carryovers upon transfer of our ownership interests in our Dresden subsidiaries to GF plus foreign taxes in profitable locations offset by discrete tax benefits, including the monetization of U.S. research and development credits.

Net cash used in financing activities was $6 million in 2011 as a result of payments of $202 million to repurchase $200 million aggregate principal amount of our 6.00% Notes. This amount was partially offset by $170 million of proceeds from our former financing arrangement with the IBM parties, $20 million in proceeds from foreign grants from the Canadian government for research and development activities related to our AMD Fusion products and from the Malaysian and Chinese governments for our local microprocessor assembly, test and packaging facilities, and $18 million from the exercise of employee stock options. During 2011, we did not realize any excess tax benefit related to stock-based compensation. Therefore, we did not record any related financing cash flows.

Net cash provided by financing activities was $484 million in 2010 primarily as a result of proceeds of $988 million from our former financing arrangement with the IBM Parties, $490 million from the sale and issuance of $500 million aggregate principal amount of the 7.75% Notes, $19 million in proceeds from foreign grants from the Canadian government for research and development activities related to our Fusion products and from the Malaysian and Chinese governments for our local microprocessor assembly, test and packaging facilities and $15 million from the exercise of employee stock options. These amounts were partially offset by payments of $1,011 million to repurchase $1,016 million aggregate principal amount of our 6.00% Notes. During 2010, we did not realize any excess tax benefit related to stock-based compensation. Therefore, we did not record any related financing cash flows.

We currently estimate that we will pay GF approximately $1.5 billion in 2012 for wafer purchases. These 2012 estimated costs are based in part on our current expectations regarding GFs manufacturing yields and wafer volumes, and the successful conclusion of our negotiations with GF and ATIC related to a second amendment to the WSA, including the pricing methodology. Costs are also impacted by variations in yields and several other factors including our current expectations regarding demand for our products. In addition, we estimate that additional purchase obligations in connection with research and development related to GF wafer production will be approximately $71 million in 2012. We are not currently able to meaningfully quantify or estimate our purchase obligations to GF beyond 2012, but we expect that our future purchases from GF will continue to be material.

The Company currently estimates that it will pay GF approximately $1.5 billion in 2012 for wafer purchases. These 2012 estimated costs are based in part on the Companys current expectations regarding GFs manufacturing yields and wafer volumes and the successful conclusion of its negotiations with GF and ATIC related to a second amendment to the WSA, including the pricing methodology.

GF continues to be a related party of the Company. The Companys total expenses related to GFs wafer manufacturing were $904 million and $1.2 billion in 2011 and 2010, respectively, The Companys total expenses related to GFs research and development activities were $79 million and $114 million for 2011 and 2010, respectively. In addition, during the first quarter of 2011, the Company incurred a charge of $24 million related to a payment to GF, primarily for certain manufacturing assets of GF, which did not benefit the Company.

As of December 31, 2011, substantially all of the Companys U.S. and foreign deferred tax assets, net of deferred tax liabilities, continued to be subject to a valuation allowance. The realization of these assets is dependent on substantial future taxable income which, at December 31, 2011, in managements estimate, is not more likely than not to be achieved. In 2011, the net valuation allowance decreased by $245 million primarily for decreases in deferred tax assets related to the utilization of net operating losses due to pre-tax book income and a change in the book to tax basis in investments. In 2010, the net valuation allowance decreased by $56 million primarily for decreases in deferred tax assets related to the utilization of net operating losses due to pre-tax book income and the utilization of foreign research and development credits to offset prior period audit adjustments, net of an increase in U.S. deferred tax assets, primarily for foreign tax credits arising from withholding taxes. In 2009, the net valuation allowance decreased by $93 million primarily for decreases in deferred tax assets related to tax deductible goodwill, intangibles and discount of convertible notes.

The statements in this report include forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and beliefs and involve numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. These forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as predictions of future events as we cannot assure you that the events or circumstances reflected in these statements will be achieved or will occur. You can identify forward-looking statements by the use of forward-looking terminology including believes, expects, may, will, should, seeks, intends, plans, pro forma, estimates, or anticipates or the negative of these words and phrases or other variations of these words and phrases or comparable terminology. The forward-looking statements relate to, among other things: demand for our products; the timing of new product releases and technology transitions; the growth and competitive landscape of the markets in which we participate; capital expenditures; our planned research and development spending; the outcome of legal proceedings and the related impact of such outcome on our financial condition or results of operations; our future payments to GLOBALFOUNDRIES Inc., or GF, under the wafer purchase agreement; our product roadmap; the non-cash gain we expect to recognize in the first quarter of 2011 as a result of the dilution of our equity interest in GF; our opportunity in 2011 in the server market; the operating results of the Handheld business unit; the level of international sales as compared to total sales; unrecognized tax benefits; and availability of external financing. Material factors and assumptions that were applied in making these forward-looking statements include, without limitation, the following: the expected rate of market growth and demand for our products and technologies (and the mix thereof); our expected market share; our expected product costs and average selling price; our overall competitive position and the competitiveness of our current and future products; our ability to introduce new products, consistent with our current roadmap; our ability to raise sufficient capital on favorable terms; our ability to make additional investment in research and development and that such opportunities will be available; our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of our fabless business model; the expected demand for computers; our current expectations regarding GFs manufacturing yields, wafer volumes and demand for our products and the state of credit markets and macroeconomic conditions. Material factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from current expectations include, without limitation, the following: that Intel Corporations pricing, marketing and rebating programs, product bundling, standard setting, new product introductions or other activities may negatively impact our plans; that we may be unable to develop, launch and ramp new products and technologies in the volumes that are required by the market at mature yields on a timely basis; that our third party foundries will be unable to manufacture our products on a timely basis in sufficient quantities and using competitive technologies; that we will be unable to obtain sufficient manufacturing capacity or components to meet demand for our products or will under-utilize our commitment with respect to GFs microprocessor manufacturing facilities; that we may be unable to realize the anticipated benefits of our fabless business model or our relationship with GF because, among other things, the synergies expected from the transaction may not be fully realized or may take longer to realize than expected; that customers stop buying our products or materially reduce their operations or demand for our products; that we may be unable to maintain the level of investment in research and development that is required to remain competitive; that there may be unexpected variations in market growth and demand for our products and technologies in light of the product mix that we may have available at any particular time or a decline in demand; that our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial position and prevent us from implementing our strategy or fulfilling our contractual obligations; that we will require additional funding and may be unable to raise sufficient capital on favorable terms, or at all; that global business and economic conditions will not continue to improve or will worsen; that demand for computers will be lower than currently expected and the effect of political or economic instability, domestically or internationally, on our sales or supply chain.

Other than Intel, our principal competitor is Nvidia. AMD and Nvidia are the two principal players offering discrete graphics solutions. Other competitors include a number of smaller companies, which may have greater flexibility to address specific market needs, but less financial resources to do so, especially as we believe that the growing complexity of visual processors and the associated research and development costs represent an increasingly higher barrier to entry in this market.

We focus our research and development activities on improving and enhancing product design. One main area of focus is on delivering the next generation of products with greater system level integration of the CPU and GPU, improved system performance and performance-per-watt characteristics. For example, we are focusing on improving the battery life of our microprocessors and APU products for notebook PCs and the power

efficiency of our microprocessors for servers. We are also focusing on delivering a range of low power integrated platforms to serve key markets, including commercial clients, mobile computing, and gaming and media computing. We believe that these integrated platforms will bring customers better time-to-market and increased performance and energy efficiency. We also work with industry leaders on process technology, software and other functional intellectual property and we work with others in the industry, public foundations, universities and industry consortia to conduct early stage research and development.

If we cannot generate sufficient revenues and operating cash flow or obtain external financing, we may face a cash shortfall and be unable to make all of our planned investments in research and development.
research and development
Although we make substantial investments in research and development, we cannot be certain that we will be able to develop, obtain or successfully implement new products and technologies on a timely basis. Our ability to fund research and development expenditures depends on generating sufficient cash flow from operations and the availability of external financing, if necessary. Our research and development expenditures, together with ongoing operating expenses, will be a substantial drain on our cash flow and may decrease our cash balances. If new competitors, technological advances by existing competitors or other competitive factors require us to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated in our research and development efforts, our operating expenses would increase. If we are required to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated in research and development efforts without an increase in revenue, our operating results could decline.
research and development
We regularly assess markets for external financing opportunities, including debt and equity financing. Additional debt or equity financing may not be available when needed or, if available, may not be available on satisfactory terms. The health of the credit markets may adversely impact our ability to obtain financing when needed. In addition, any downgrades from credit rating agencies such as Moodys or Standard & Poors may adversely impact our ability to obtain external financing or the terms of such financing. Credit agency downgrades may also impact relationships with our suppliers, who may limit our credit lines. Our inability to obtain needed financing or to generate sufficient cash from operations may require us to abandon projects or curtail planned investments in research and development. If we curtail planned investments in research and development or abandon projects, our products may fail to remain competitive and our business would be materially adversely affected.

At December 25, 2010, we owned principal research and development, engineering, manufacturing, warehouse and administrative facilities located in the United States, Canada, Taiwan, China, Singapore and Malaysia. These facilities totaled approximately 2.4 million square feet.
research and development
Our main facility with respect to our graphics and chipset products is located in Markham, Ontario, Canada. This facility consists of approximately 240,000 square feet of office and research and development space. We occupy two other facilities in Markham, Ontario that comprise over 215,000 square feet, including approximately 65,000 square-feet of manufacturing and warehouse space. We also currently own and operate three microprocessor assembly and test facilities comprising an aggregate of 465,000 square feet. Our current microprocessor assembly and test facilities are located in Malaysia, Singapore and China and are described in further detail in the Assembly, Test, Mark and Packaging Facilities, above.

In June 2009, the FASB issued an amendment to improve financial reporting by enterprises involved with variable interest entities. This new guidance became effective for us beginning the first day of 2010. Under the new guidance, the investor who is deemed to both (i) have the power to direct the activities of the variable interest entity that most significantly impact the variable interest entitys economic performance and (ii) be exposed to losses and returns will be the primary beneficiary who should then consolidate the variable interest entity. We evaluated whether the governance changes described above would, pursuant to the new guidance, affect our consolidation of GF. We considered the purpose and design of GF, the activities of GF that most significantly affect the economic performance of GF and the concept of who has the power, as contemplated by the new guidance. Based on the results of this evaluation and in light of the governance changes whereby we believe we only had protective rights relative to the operations of GF, we concluded that the other investor in GF, ATIC, is the party who has the power to direct the activities of GF that most significantly impact GFs performance and is, therefore, the primary beneficiary of GF. Accordingly, effective as of December 27, 2009, we deconsolidated GF and started accounting for our ownership interest in GF under the equity method of accounting. For purposes of our application of the equity method of accounting during 2010, we recorded our share of GFs results, excluding the results of Chartered because GF did not have an equity ownership interest in Chartered. The terms of the Funding Agreement and the Wafer Supply Agreement described above were not affected by the deconsolidation of GF. Following the deconsolidation, GF became our related party. Our expenses related to GFs wafer manufacturing were $1.2 billion and related to GFs research and development activities were $114 million for the year ended December 25, 2010.
research and development
Computing Solutions operating income was $529 million in 2010 compared to $142 million in 2009. The improvement was primarily due to the increase in net revenue referenced above and a $25 million decrease in cost of sales, partially offset by a $224 million increase in research and development expenses and a $61 million increase in marketing, general and administrative expenses. Cost of sales decreased due to reductions in manufacturing costs and a one-time benefit related to the deconsolidation of GF in 2010. Research and development expenses and marketing, general and administrative expenses increased for the reasons set forth under Expenses, below.
research and development
Computing Solutions operating income was $142 million in 2009 compared to an operating loss of $458 million in 2008. Operating results for 2009 are not comparable to operating results for 2008 because of the creation of the Foundry segment in the first quarter of 2009, which resulted in our reporting certain research and development and marketing, general and administrative expenses in the Foundry segment that we would previously have reported in the Computing Solutions segment. Operating loss in 2008 included a $193 million gain on the sale of 200 millimeter equipment and $191 million of process technology license revenue that did not occur in 2009.

cost of sales due to higher GPU unit shipments, a $22 million increase in research and development expenses and a $15 million increase in marketing, general and administrative expenses. Research and development expenses and marketing, general and administrative expenses increased for the reasons set forth under Expenses, below.
research and development
All Other operating income in 2010 was $170 million compared to $968 million in 2009. The decrease in operating results was primarily attributable to an absence of $1.2 billion of income from the settlement of our litigation with Intel in the fourth quarter of 2009 and the decrease in revenue referenced above, partially offset by $283 million of income from the settlement of our litigation with Samsung in the fourth quarter of 2010, a $77 million decrease in cost of sales, an absence of $65 million in restructuring charges, a $38 million decrease in research and development expenses, a $21 million decrease in marketing, general and administrative expenses and a $9 million decrease in amortization due to certain fully amortized acquired intangible assets. Cost of sales decreased primarily due to a one-time benefit recognized in the first quarter of 2010 related to the deconsolidation of GF and lower Handheld product unit shipments. Research and development expenses and marketing, general and administrative expenses decreased for the reasons set forth under Expenses, below.

Research and Development Expenses
research and development
Research and development expenses of $1.4 billion in 2010, decreased by $316 million, or 18%, compared to $1.7 billion in 2009. In 2009, research and development expenses included $524 million in research and development expenses related to the Foundry segment. Without taking into account the research and development expenses attributable to the Foundry segment, which are not indicative of our ongoing performance, research and development expenses would have increased by $208 million in 2010 as compared to 2009. This increase was due to a $224 million increase in research and development expenses attributable to our Computing Solutions segment and a $22 million increase in research and development expenses attributable to our Graphics segment, partially offset by a $38 million decrease in research and development expenses attributable to our All Other category. The increase in research and development expenses attributable to our Computing Solutions segment was primarily due to a $91 million increase in product engineering and design costs for our future products, a $68 million increase in employee benefit and compensation expense and a $64 million increase in manufacturing process technology expenses related to GF for our future products. The increase in research and development expenses attributable to our Graphics segment was primarily due to a $33 million increase in employee benefit and compensation expense, partially offset by a $13 million decrease in product engineering and design costs due to lower material costs used in 2010. The decrease in research and development expenses attributable to our All Other category was primarily because of lower research and development expenses related to handheld products because we no longer develop these products.
research and development
Research and development expenses decreased $127 million, or 7%, from $1.8 billion in 2008 to $1.7 billion in 2009. This decrease was primarily due to a $193 million decrease in product engineering and design costs, which reflected our efforts to reduce operating expenses, and was partially offset by a $62 million increase in manufacturing process technology expenses mainly incurred by GF.
research and development
In 2009, GF applied for subsidies relating to certain research and development projects, and in 2008 we applied for these subsidies. We recorded these research and development subsidies in our consolidated financial statements as a reduction of research and development expenses when all conditions and requirements set forth in the subsidy allowance were met. The credit to research and development expenses was $46 million in 2009 and $36 million in 2008. With the deconsolidation of GF in 2010, we no longer record these credits in our consolidated financial statements.
research and development
The income tax provision in 2010 was primarily due to withholding taxes paid to the Korean tax authorities in connection with the payment we received from Samsung in December 2010 pursuant to the Patent License and Settlement Agreement as well as foreign taxes in profitable locations offset by benefits including the monetization of U.S. research and development credits, an alternative minimum tax refund on net operating loss carryback in the United States and the reversal of unrecognized tax benefits in foreign jurisdictions.
research and development
The income tax provision in 2009 was primarily due to a one-time loss of deferred tax assets for German net operating loss carryovers upon transfer of our ownership interests in the Dresden subsidiaries to GF plus foreign taxes in profitable locations offset by discrete tax benefits, including the monetization of U.S. research and development credits.
research and development
Net cash provided by financing activities was $484 million in 2010 primarily as a result of proceeds of $988 million from our financing arrangements with the IBM Parties, $490 million from the sale and issuance of $500 million aggregate principal amount of the 7.75% Notes, $19 million in proceeds from foreign grants from the Canadian government for research and development activities related to our Fusion products and from the Malaysian and Chinese governments for our local microprocessor assembly, test and packaging facilities and $15 million from the exercise of employee stock options. These amounts were partially offset by payments of $1,011 million to repurchase $1,016 million aggregate principal amount of our 6.00% Notes. During 2010, we did not realize any excess tax benefit related to stock-based compensation. Therefore, we did not record any related financing cash flows.
research and development
The Company also received an investment grant relating to certain research and development projects. These research and development funds are recorded as a reduction of research and development expenses when all conditions and requirements set forth in the underlying grant agreement are met.

As of December 25, 2010, substantially all of the Companys U.S. and foreign deferred tax assets, net of deferred tax liabilities, continued to be subject to a valuation allowance. The realization of these assets is dependent on substantial future taxable income which, at December 25, 2010, in managements estimate, is not more likely than not to be achieved. In 2010, the net valuation allowance decreased by $56 million primarily for decreases in deferred tax assets related to the utilization of net operating losses due to pre-tax book income and the utilization of foreign research and development credits to offset prior period audit adjustments, net of an increase in U.S. deferred tax assets, primarily for foreign tax credits arising from withholding taxes. In 2009, the net valuation allowance decreased by $93 million primarily for decreases in deferred tax assets related to tax deductible goodwill, intangibles and discount of convertible notes. In 2008, the net valuation allowance increased by $1.1 billion primarily to provide valuation allowance for deferred tax assets related to tax deductible goodwill, intangibles and discount of convertible notes.

Intel has substantially greater financial resources than we do and accordingly spends substantially greater amounts on research and development and production capacity than we do. We expect Intel to maintain its dominant position and to continue to invest heavily in marketing, research and development, new manufacturing facilities and other technology companies. To the extent Intel manufactures a significantly larger portion of its microprocessor products using more advanced process technologies, or introduces competitive new products into the market before we do, we may be more vulnerable to Intels aggressive marketing and pricing strategies for microprocessor products. For example, Intel is transitioning to 32 nm process technology before us. Using more advanced process technology can contribute to lower product manufacturing costs and improve a products performance and power efficiency. We expect intense competition from Intel to continue.

Operating results for 2009 are not comparable to operating results for 2008 because of the creation of the Foundry segment in the first quarter of 2009, which resulted in our reporting certain research and development and marketing, general and administrative expenses in the Foundry segment that we would previously have reported in the Computing Solutions segment. Operating loss in 2008 included a $193 million gain on the sale of 200 millimeter equipment and $191 million of process technology license revenue that did not occur in 2009.
research and development
Computing Solutions operating loss was $461 million in 2008 compared to an operating loss of $712 million in 2007. The reduction in operating loss was due to the recognition of the $191 million of process technology license revenue referenced above, a $193 million gain on the sale of 200 millimeter equipment that did not occur in 2007, a $168 million decrease in cost of sales, and a $97 million decrease in marketing, general and administrative expenses partially offset by a $63 million increase in research and development expenses. Cost of sales decreased due to lower microprocessor unit volume and manufacturing cost reductions in 2008. The lower costs were partially offset by a $214 million incremental write-down of inventory related to Computing Solutions products in the fourth quarter of 2008. Research and development expenses increased and marketing, general and administrative expenses decreased for the reasons set forth under Expenses below.
research and development
Graphics operating income in 2008 was $12 million compared to an operating loss of $39 million in 2007. The $51 million operating improvement was due to the increase in revenue referenced above. The increase in revenue was partially offset by a $77 million increase in cost of sales because of higher GPU unit shipments and increased research and development and marketing, general and administrative expenses, which increased for the reasons set forth under Expenses below.

Research and Development Expenses
research and development
Research and development expenses decreased $127 million, or 7 percent, from $1.8 billion in 2008 to $1.7 billion in 2009. This decrease was primarily due to a $193 million decrease in product engineering and design costs, which reflected our efforts to reduce operating expenses, and was partially offset by a $62 million increase in manufacturing process technology expenses mainly incurred by GF. As a result of the deconsolidation of GF, we expect that our future research and development expenses will decrease.
research and development
Research and development expenses increased $77 million, or 4 percent, from $1,771 million in 2007 to $1,848 million in 2008. This increase was primarily due to a $63 million increase in research and development expenses attributable to the Computing Solutions segment and a $9 million increase in research and development expenses attributable to the Graphics segment. Research and development expenses for the Computing Solutions segment increased primarily due to higher product engineering and design costs for our next generation microprocessor products and start-up costs for our former manufacturing facility, Fab 38. Research and development expenses for the Graphics segment increased primarily due to higher product engineering and design costs.
research and development
From time to time, GF applies for subsidies relating to certain research and development projects. We recorded these research and development subsidies in our consolidated financial statements as a reduction of research and development expenses when all conditions and requirements set forth in the subsidy allowance are met. The credit to research and development expenses was $46 million in 2009, $36 million in 2008 and $30 million in 2007.

In the fourth quarter of 2007, pursuant to our accounting policy, we performed an annual impairment test of goodwill. As a result of this analysis, we concluded that the carrying amounts of goodwill included in our Graphics and former Consumer Electronics segments exceeded their implied fair values and recorded an impairment charge of approximately $1.26 billion, of which $913 million is included in the caption Impairment of goodwill and acquired intangible assets and $346 million is included in the caption Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax in our 2007 consolidated statement of operations. The impairment charge was determined by comparing the carrying value of goodwill assigned to the reporting units within these segments as of October 1, 2007, with the implied fair value of the goodwill. We considered both the income and market approaches in determining the implied fair value of the goodwill. While market valuation data for comparable companies was gathered and analyzed, we concluded that there was not sufficient comparability between the peer groups and the specific reporting units to allow for the derivation of reliable indications of value using a market approach, and therefore we ultimately employed the income approach which requires estimates of future operating results and cash flows of each of the reporting units, discounted using estimated discount rates ranging from 13 percent to 15 percent. The estimates of future operating results and cash flows were principally derived from an updated long-term financial forecast, which was developed as part of our strategic planning cycle conducted annually during the latter part of the third quarter of 2007. The decline in the implied fair value of the goodwill and resulting impairment charge was primarily driven by the updated long-term financial forecasts, which showed lower estimated near-term and longer-term profitability compared to estimates developed at the time of the completion of the ATI acquisition. The updated financial forecast for our Graphics segment was lower primarily because of intense pricing competition with Nvidia throughout 2007, which required an increase in sales and marketing activities to a greater extent than we previously forecasted. In addition, we had invested in the development of new graphics technologies to a greater extent than previously forecasted, which resulted in an increase in research and development expenses. Also, Intel announced its intention to develop a discrete graphics product. These factors resulted in lower near-term and longer-term forecasts of Graphics business revenues, operating profitability and cash flows compared to the forecasts at the time of the ATI acquisition.
research and development
We recorded an income tax provision of $112 million in 2009, $68 million in 2008 and $27 million in 2007. The income tax provision in 2009 was primarily due to a one-time loss of deferred tax assets for German net operating loss carryovers upon transfer of our ownership interests in the Dresden subsidiaries to GF plus foreign taxes in profitable locations offset by discrete tax benefits including the monetization of U.S. research and development credits. The income tax provision in 2008 primarily resulted from increases in net deferred tax liabilities in our former German subsidiaries reduced by net current tax benefits in other jurisdictions. The income tax provision in 2007 primarily resulted from current foreign taxes reduced by the reversal of deferred U.S. taxes related to indefinite-lived goodwill, resulting from the goodwill impairment charge we recorded during the year, and recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits for tax holidays.
research and development
As of December 26, 2009, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances were approximately $2.7 billion, which included $904 million of GFs cash and cash equivalents. Taking into account the 2010 deconsolidation of GF, we believe that cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances as of December 26, 2009, anticipated cash flow from operations and available external financing will be sufficient to fund operations, including capital expenditures of approximately $160 million over the next twelve months related to, among other things, IT, our assembly and test facilities and investments supporting research and development efforts, including AMD Fusion product development. In addition, our debt and capital lease obligations as of December 26, 2009 were $4.7 billion, of which $2.0 billion represented GF obligations. In 2009, without taking into account GFs indebtedness, we reduced our debt by approximately $1.2 billion.

research and development
Intel has substantially greater financial resources than we do and accordingly spends substantially greater amounts on research and development and production capacity than we do. We expect Intel to maintain its dominant position and to continue to invest heavily in marketing, research and development, new manufacturing facilities and other technology companies. To the extent Intel manufactures a significantly larger portion of its microprocessor products using more advanced process technologies, or introduces competitive new products into the market before we do, we may be more vulnerable to Intels aggressive marketing and pricing strategies for microprocessor products. We expect intense competition from Intel to continue.
development cost
Other than Intel, our principal competitor is Nvidia Corporation, and to a lesser extent, Matrox Electronic Systems Ltd., Silicon Integrated Systems Corp. and Via Technologies, Inc. Other competitors include a number of smaller companies, which may have greater flexibility to address specific market needs, but lesser financial resources to do so, especially as we believe that the growing complexity of visual processors and the associated research and development costs represent an increasingly high barrier to entry in this market.

Research and Development
research and development
We focus our microprocessor research and development activities on product design and system and manufacturing process development. One main area of focus is on delivering the next generation of microprocessors with improved system performance and performance-per-watt characteristics. We have devoted significant resources to product design and to developing and improving manufacturing process technologies. We also work with other industry leaders, public foundations, universities and industry consortia to conduct early stage research and development.
research and development
With respect to graphics, our primary research and development objective is to develop products and technologies that meet the ever-changing demands of the PC industry on a timely basis so as to meet market windows. We are also focusing on delivering a range of integrated platforms to serve key markets, including commercial clients, mobile computing, and gaming and media computing. We believe that these integrated platforms will bring customers improved system stability, better time-to-market and increased performance and energy efficiency. Longer-term, our research and development efforts are focused on developing monolithic silicon solutions for specialized uses that are comprised of microprocessors, graphics processors and video processors.
research and development
Our research and development expenses for 2008, 2007, and 2006 were approximately $1.8 billion, $1.8 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively. However, research and development expenses for 2006 are not comparable to prior years because they included ATIs research and development expenses only from October 25, 2006 through December 31, 2006. For more information, see Part II, Item 7Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, or MD&A.
research and development
We conduct product and system research and development activities for our microprocessor products in the United States with additional design and development engineering teams located in Germany, Singapore, China, Japan, Malaysia, Taiwan and India. We conduct research and development activities for our graphics and chipset products at design centers located throughout the world, including in the United States, Canada, India and China.

Intel has substantially greater financial resources than we do and, accordingly, spends substantially greater amounts on research and development and production capacity than we do. We expect Intel to maintain its dominant position and to continue to invest heavily in marketing, research and development, new manufacturing facilities and other technology companies. To the extent Intel manufactures a significantly larger portion of its microprocessor products using more advanced process technologies, or introduces competitive new products into the market before we do, we may be more vulnerable to Intels aggressive marketing and pricing strategies for microprocessor products.
research and development
If we cannot generate sufficient revenues and operating cash flow or obtain external financing, we may face a cash shortfall and be unable to make all of our planned investments in research and development.
research and development
Although we make substantial investments in research and development, we cannot be certain that we will be able to develop, obtain or successfully implement new products and technologies on a timely basis. Our ability to fund research and development expenditures depends on generating sufficient cash flow from operations and the availability of external financing, if necessary. Our research and development expenditures, together with ongoing operating expenses, will be a substantial drain on our cash flow and may decrease our cash balances. If new competitors, technological advances by existing competitors or other competitive factors require us to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated in our research and development efforts, our operating expenses would increase. If we are required to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated in research and development efforts without an increase in revenue, our operating results could decline. During 2008, we incurred substantial losses that had a negative impact on cash balances. During 2008, net cash used in operating activities was $692 million. As of December 27, 2008, we had approximately $1.1 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities.
research and development
We regularly assess markets for external financing opportunities, including debt and equity financing. Additional debt or equity financing may not be available when needed or, if available, may not be available on satisfactory terms. The recent developments in the credit markets may adversely impact our ability to obtain financing when needed. Our inability to obtain needed financing or to generate sufficient cash from operations may require us to abandon projects or curtail planned investments in research and development. If we curtail planned investments in research and development or abandon projects, our products may fail to remain competitive and we would be materially adversely affected.
research and development
If we are unable to comply with the covenants in the subsidy grant documents that we receive from the State of Saxony, the Federal Republic of Germany and/or the European Union for Fab 30, Fab 36, Fab 38 or other research and development projects we may undertake in Germany, we may forfeit or have to repay our subsidies, which could materially adversely affect us.

At December 27, 2008, we owned principal engineering, manufacturing, warehouse and administrative facilities located in the United States, Canada, China, Germany, Singapore and Malaysia. These facilities totaled approximately 4.5 million square feet. Of this amount, 2.2 million square feet were located in Dresden, Germany and were used primarily for wafer fabrication, research and development, and administrative offices.
research and development
Our main facility with respect to our graphics and chipset products is located in Markham, Ontario, Canada. This facility consists of approximately 240,000 square feet of office and research and development space. We occupy five other facilities in Markham, Ontario that comprise over 265,000 square feet, including approximately 65,000 square-feet of manufacturing and warehouse space.

In 2008 we also made progress towards improving our competitive position across both of our businesses. In November 2008 we launched our first 45-nanometer quad-core AMD Opteron processors, and we expect the transition to 45-nanometer process technology to be completed at Fab 36 by mid-2009. In 2008 and early 2009, we also introduced several new platform products such as our Puma and Yukon platforms for notebooks and our Dragon platform for desktop PCs. With respect to graphics products, we released the ATI Radeon HD 4000 series of products in June 2008. Despite the cost cutting efforts referenced above, one of our key priorities for 2009 is to continue to invest in research and development and to maintain the competitiveness of our product roadmap.

In-Process Research and Development
r&d
Of the total purchase price, approximately $416 million was allocated to in-process research and development (IPR&D) and was expensed in the fourth quarter of 2006. Projects that qualified as IPR&D represented those that had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use at the time of the acquisition. These projects included development of next generation products for the Graphics segment and Chipsets business unit and the former Consumer Electronics segment. The estimated fair value of the projects for the Graphics segment and Chipsets business unit was approximately $193 million ($122 million for graphics products and $71 million for chipset products). The estimated fair value of the projects for the former Consumer
r&d
The value assigned to IPR&D was determined using a discounted cash flow methodology, specifically an excess earnings approach, which estimates value based upon the discounted value of future cash flows expected to be generated by the in-process projects, net of all contributory asset returns. The approach includes consideration of the importance of each project to the overall development plan and estimating costs to develop the purchased IPR&D into commercially viable products. The revenue estimates used to value the purchased IPR&D were based on estimates of the relevant market sizes and growth factors, expected trends in technology and the nature and expected timing of new product introductions by ATI and its competitors.
research and development
The updated financial forecast for our Graphics segment was lower primarily because of intense pricing competition with our primary competitor throughout 2007, which required an increase in sales and marketing activities to a greater extent than we previously forecasted. In addition, we had invested in the development of new graphics technologies to a greater extent than previously forecasted, which resulted in an increase in research and development expenses. Also, Intel announced its intention to develop a discrete graphics product. These factors resulted in lower near-term and longer-term forecasts of Graphics business revenues, operating profitability and cash flows compared to the forecasts at the time of the ATI acquisition.
research and development
In accordance with business combination accounting, we have allocated the purchase price of ATI to related tangible and intangible assets acquired, including in-process research and development, and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. These valuations require us to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to acquisition-related intangible assets.
research and development
We made estimates of fair value of the ATI assets acquired and liabilities assumed using reasonable assumptions based on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired company. Critical estimates in valuing certain of the acquisition-related intangible assets included but were not limited to: future expected cash flows from the sale of products, expected costs to develop in-process research and development projects into commercially viable products and estimated cash flows from the projects when completed; the markets awareness of the acquired companys brand and the acquired companys market position, as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired brand will continue to be used in the

Computing Solutions operating loss was $461 million in 2008 compared to an operating loss of $712 million in 2007. The reduction in operating loss was due to the recognition of the $191 million of process technology license revenue referenced above, a $193 million gain on the sale of 200 millimeter equipment that did not occur in 2007, a $168 million decrease in cost of sales, a $97 million decrease in marketing, general and administrative expenses partially offset by a $63 million increase in research and development expenses. See Part II, Item 7MD&AGain on sale of 200 millimeter equipment and the license of related process technology below, for additional information. Cost of sales decreased due to lower microprocessor unit volume and manufacturing cost reductions in 2008. The lower costs were partially offset by a $214 million incremental write-down of inventory related to Computing Solutions products in the fourth quarter of 2008. Research and development expenses increased and marketing, general and administrative expenses decreased for the reasons set forth under Expenses, below.
research and development
Computing Solutions operating loss was $712 million in 2007 compared to operating income of $679 million in 2006. The decline in operating results was primarily due to the $665 million decrease in revenue described above, a $307 million increase in manufacturing expenses, a $329 million increase in research and development expenses and a $91 million increase in marketing, general and administrative expenses. Research and development expenses and marketing, general and administrative expenses increased for the reasons set forth
research and development
Graphics operating income in 2008 was $12 million compared to an operating loss of $39 million in 2007. The $51 million operating improvement was due to the increase in revenue referenced above. The increase in revenue was partially offset by a $77 million increase in cost of sales because of higher unit shipments and increased research and development and marketing, general and administrative expenses, which increased for the reasons set forth under Expenses below.
research and development
All Other operating loss of $1.6 billion in 2007 increased $869 million compared to an operating loss of $690 million in 2006. The increase in operating loss was primarily attributable to ATI acquisition-related impairment charges of $1.1 billion, which included a goodwill write-down of $913 million and a write-down of acquired intangible assets of $219 million and an increase of $173 million in amortization of acquired intangible assets, partially offset by a decrease in ATI acquisition-related charges of $448 million. Acquisition-related charges in 2006 included a $416 million charge for acquired in-process research and development, which did not recur in 2007. See ATI Acquisition above, for additional information.
research and development
Research and Development Expenses
research and development
Research and development expenses increased $77 million, or 4 percent, from $1.8 billion in 2007 to $1.9 billion in 2008. This increase was primarily due to a $63 million increase in research and development expenses attributable to the Computing Solutions segment and a $9 million increase in research and development expenses attributable to our Graphics segment. Research and development expenses for the Computing Solutions segment increased primarily due to higher product engineering and design costs for our next generation microprocessor products and start-up costs for Fab 38. Research and development expenses for the Graphics segment increased primarily due to higher product engineering and design costs.
research and development
Research and development expenses increased $581 million, or 49 percent, from $1.2 billion in 2006 to $1.8 billion in 2007. The increase was primarily attributable to: a $329 million increase in research and development expenses attributable to our Computing Solutions segment and a $189 million increase in research and development expenses attributable to our Graphics segment. Research and development expenses attributable to our Computing Solutions segment increased due primarily to higher product engineering and design costs for our next generation microprocessor products. In addition, research and development expenses attributable to ATIs chipset business were included for the full year in 2007 compared to only nine weeks in 2006. Research and development expenses attributable to our Graphics segment increased primarily due to the inclusion of operations related to this segment for the full year in 2007 compared to nine weeks in 2006.
research and development
From time to time, we also apply for subsidies relating to certain research and development projects. These research and development subsidies are recorded as a reduction of research and development expenses when all conditions and requirements set forth in the subsidy grant are met. The credit to research and development expenses totaled $36 million in 2008, $30 million in 2007 and $27 million in 2006.

In-process research and development, amortization of acquired intangible assets and integration charges, and impairment of goodwill and acquired intangible assets.
research and development
In-process research and development charges of $416 million in 2006 related to projects acquired in connection with the acquisition of ATI. Amortization of acquired intangible assets and integration charges increased $169 million, or 252 percent, from $67 million in 2006 to $236 million in 2007. This increase was primarily attributable to a $173 million increase in amortization of acquired intangible assets, partially offset by a $4 million decrease in charges related to the integration of AMD and ATI operations. Amortization of acquired intangible assets increased primarily due to the inclusion of charges for the full year in 2007 compared to nine weeks in 2006. See Part II, Item 7 MD&AATI Acquisition above, for additional information.
research and development
Net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $1.3 billion in 2006. Our net loss of $166 million was adjusted for non-cash charges consisting primarily of $837 million of depreciation and amortization expense, $416 million for the write-off of in-process research and development expenses related to the ATI acquisition, stock-based compensation expense of $77 million, and $45 million related to an equity interest in the net loss of Spansion. These charges were partially offset by amortization of foreign grants and subsidies of $151 million. The net changes in our operating assets at December 31, 2006 compared to December 25, 2005 included an increase of $530 million in accounts payable and accrued liabilities, partially offset by a decrease in payables to related parties of $229 million and an increase of $175 million in other assets. The increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities was primarily related to higher purchases of raw materials, technology license payment obligations, and marketing accruals due to increased operations in the Computing Solutions segment. The decrease in payables to related parties is a result of our no longer shipping products and invoicing customers on behalf of Spansion after the second quarter of 2006. Prior to the second quarter of 2006, we shipped products to and invoiced Spansions customers in our name on behalf of Spansion and remitted the receipts to Spansion. The increase in other assets was primarily due to purchases of new technology licenses.

In connection with the receipt of investment grants for the Fab 36 project, AMD Fab 36 KG is required to attain a certain employee headcount by December 2008 and is required to maintain this headcount through December 2013. We record these grants as long-term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet and amortize them to operations ratably starting from December 2004 through December 2013. Initially, we amortized the grant amounts as a reduction to research and development expenses. Beginning in the first quarter of 2006 when Fab 36 began producing revenue generating products, we started amortizing these amounts as a reduction to cost of sales. Allowances are amortized as a reduction of depreciation expense ratably over the life of the investments because these allowances are intended to subsidize the capital investments. Noncompliance with the covenants contained in the subsidy documents could result in the repayment of all or a portion of the amounts received to date.

In connection with the acquisition of ATI, we made several commitments to the Minister of Industry under the Investment Canada Act including that we will: increase spending on research and development in Canada to a specified amount over the course of a three-year period when compared to ATIs expenditures in this area in prior years; maintain Canadian employee headcount at specified levels by the end of the three-year anniversary of the acquisition; increase by a specified amount the number of our Canadian employees focusing on research and development; attain specified Canadian capital expenditures over a three-year period; maintain a presence in Canada via a variety of commercial activities for a period of five years; and nominate a Canadian for election to our Board of Directors over the next five years. The remaining minimum required Canadian capital expenditures

(SFAS 141(R)). Under SFAS 141(R), an entity is required to recognize the assets acquired, liabilities assumed, contractual contingencies, and contingent consideration at their fair value on the acquisition date. It further requires that acquisition-related costs be recognized separately from the acquisition and expensed as incurred; that restructuring costs generally be expensed in periods subsequent to the acquisition date; and that changes in accounting for deferred tax asset valuation allowances and acquired income tax uncertainties after the measurement period be recognized as a component of provision for taxes. In addition, acquired in-process research and development is capitalized as an intangible asset and amortized over its estimated useful life. The adoption of SFAS 141(R) will change our accounting treatment for business combinations on a prospective basis beginning in the first quarter of 2009.

Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (the Company or AMD) is a global semiconductor company with manufacturing, research and development, and sales and administrative facilities throughout the world. References herein to the Company mean AMD and its consolidated wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries. The Company provides processing solutions for the computing and graphics markets. On October 25, 2006 the Company completed the acquisition of ATI Technologies Inc. (ATI) (see Note 3). As a result of the acquisition, AMD began to supply 3D graphic, video and multimedia products and chipsets for personal computers, or PCs, including desktop and notebook PCs, professional workstations, and servers and products for consumer electronic devices such as mobile phones, digital televisions and game consoles. During the fourth quarter of 2008,, the Company completed the sale of its Digital Television business unit to Broadcom Corporation. As a result, the Company no longer sells video processors used in digital television products.

(SFAS 141(R)). Under SFAS 141(R), an entity is required to recognize the assets acquired, liabilities assumed, contractual contingencies, and contingent consideration at their fair value on the acquisition date. It further requires that acquisition-related costs be recognized separately from the acquisition and expensed as incurred; that restructuring costs generally be expensed in periods subsequent to the acquisition date; and that changes in accounting for deferred tax asset valuation allowances and acquired income tax uncertainties after the measurement period be recognized as a component of the provision for taxes. In addition, acquired in-process research and development is measured at fair value, capitalized as an indefinite-life intangible asset and tested for impairment pursuant to FASB Statement No. 142,

Of the total purchase price, approximately $416 million was allocated to in-process research and development (IPR&D) and was expensed in the fourth quarter of 2006. Projects that qualified as IPR&D represented those that had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use at the time of the acquisition. These projects included development of next generation products for the Graphics segment and Chipsets business unit and the former Consumer Electronics segment. The estimated fair values of the projects for the Graphics segment and Chipsets business unit was approximately $193 million ($122 million for

The following unaudited pro forma statement of operations information gives effect to the ATI acquisition as if it had occurred at the beginning of the fiscal year presented. The pro forma information is presented for informational purposes only and is not indicative of the results of operations that would have been achieved if the acquisition and the $2.5 billion October 2006 Term Loan had taken place at the beginning of each the period presented nor is it indicative of future financial performance. The pro forma financial information for the period presented includes the nonrecurring business combination accounting effect on ATI inventories acquired, write off of in-process research and development and integration charges as well as the recurring effect from amortization of acquired intangible assets, stock-based compensation charges for unvested stock awards assumed and increase in interest expense associated with the October 2006 Term Loan.
research and development
The updated financial forecast for the Graphics segment was lower primarily because of intense pricing competition with its primary competitor throughout 2007 which required an increase in the Companys sales and marketing activities to a greater extent than previously forecasted. In addition, the Company had invested in the development of new graphics technologies to a greater extent than previously forecasted, which resulted in an increase in research and development expenses. Also the Companys primary microprocessor competitor announced its intention to develop a discrete graphics product. These factors resulted in lower near-term and longer-term forecasts of Graphics business revenues, operating profitability and cash flows compared to the Companys forecasts at the time of the completion of the ATI acquisition.

In connection with the receipt of investment grants for the Fab 36 project AMD Fab 36 KG is required to attain a certain employee headcount by December 2008 and is required to maintain this headcount through December 2013. The Company records these grants as long-term liabilities on the Companys consolidated balance sheet and amortizes them to operations ratably starting from December 2004 through December 2013. Initially the Company amortized the grant amounts as a reduction to research and development expenses. Beginning in the first quarter of 2006 when Fab 36 began producing revenue generating products, the Company started amortizing these amounts as a reduction to cost of sales. Allowances are amortized as a reduction of depreciation expense ratably over the life of the investments because these allowances are intended to subsidize the capital investments. Noncompliance with the covenants contained in the subsidy documents could result in the repayment of all or a portion of the amounts received to date.

In connection with the acquisition of ATI, the Company made several commitments to the Minister of Industry under the Investment Canada Act including that it will: increase spending on research and development in Canada to a specified amount over the course of a three-year period when compared to ATIs expenditures in this area in prior years; maintain Canadian employee headcount at specified levels by the end of the three-year anniversary of the acquisition; increase by a specified amount the number of Canadian employees focusing on research and development; attain specified Canadian capital expenditures over a three-year period; maintain a presence in Canada via a variety of commercial activities for a period of five years; and nominate a Canadian for election to the Companys Board of Directors over the next five years. The Companys remaining minimum required Canadian capital expenditures and research and development commitments are included in its aggregate unconditional purchase commitments. The Companys commitments relating to the parts of the Handheld and Digital Television business units that were divested no longer apply. The Company is in substantial compliance with the commitments.

research and development
We expect Intel to maintain its dominant position in the microprocessor market and to continue to invest heavily in marketing, research and development, new manufacturing facilities and other technology companies. Intel has substantially greater financial resources than we do and accordingly spends substantially greater amounts on research and development and production capacity than we do. We expect intense competition from Intel to continue.
development cost
Other than Intel, our principal competitor is Nvidia Corporation, and to a lesser extent, Matrox Electronic Systems Ltd., Silicon Integrated Systems Corp. and Via Technologies, Inc. Other competitors include a number of smaller companies, which may have greater flexibility to address specific market needs, but lesser financial resources to do so, especially as we believe that the growing complexity of visual processors and the associated research and development costs represent an increasingly high barrier to entry in this market.

Research and Development
research and development
We focus our microprocessor research and development activities on product design and system and manufacturing process development. One main area of focus is on delivering the next generation of microprocessors with improved system performance and performance-per-watt characteristics. We have devoted significant resources to product design and to developing and improving manufacturing process technologies and plan to continue to do so in the future. We also work with other industry leaders, public foundations, universities and industry consortia to conduct early stage research and development.
research and development
With respect to graphics and chipsets and products for consumer electronics devices, our primary research and development objective is to develop products and technologies that meet the ever-changing demands of the PC and consumer electronics industries on a timely basis so as to meet market windows. We are also focusing on delivering a range of integrated platforms to serve key markets, including commercial clients, mobile computing, and gaming and media computing. We believe that these integrated platforms will bring customers improved system stability, better time-to-market and increased performance and energy efficiency. Longer-term, our research and development efforts are focused on developing monolithic silicon solutions for specialized uses that are comprised of microprocessors, graphics processors and video processors.
research and development
Our research and development expenses for 2007, 2006, and 2005 were approximately $1.8 billion, $1.2 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively. Research and development expenses for 2006 and 2007 included ATIs research and development expenses from October 25, 2006 through December 29, 2007. For more information, see Part II, Item 7Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, or MD&A.
research and development
We conduct product and system research and development activities for our microprocessor products in the United States with additional design and development engineering teams located in Germany, Singapore, China, Japan, Malaysia, Taiwan and India.
research and development
We conduct our microprocessor manufacturing process development activities primarily through our joint development agreement with IBM. Under this agreement, we jointly develop new process technologies, including 45-nanometer, 32-nanometer, 22-nanometer and certain other advanced technologies, to be implemented on silicon wafers. Our relationship also includes laboratory-based research of emerging technologies such as new transistor, interconnect, lithography and die-to-package connection technologies. We pay fees to IBM for joint development projects. The actual amounts we pay to IBM are dependent upon the number of partners, including us and IBM, engaged in related development projects under the agreement. In addition, we agreed to pay IBM specified royalties upon the occurrence of specified events, including in the event that we sublicense the jointly developed process technologies to specified third parties or if we bump wafers for a third party. Bumping wafers is one of the final stages of the manufacturing process in which wafers are prepared for assembly and test. For more information on the fees paid or payable to IBM, see Part II, Item 7, Contractual Cash Obligations and GuaranteesUnconditional Purchase Commitments, and Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors. We cannot be certain that our substantial investments in research and development will lead to timely improvements in product designs or technology used to manufacture our products or that we will have sufficient resources to invest in the level of research and development that is required to remain competitive.
research and development
Under the agreement, our joint development relationship continues through December 31, 2011. Our agreement with IBM may be extended further by the mutual agreement of the parties and can also be terminated immediately by either party if the other party permanently ceases doing business, becomes bankrupt or insolvent, liquidates or undergoes a change of control or can be terminated by either party upon 30 days written notice upon a failure of the other party to perform a material obligation thereunder. Under our agreement, research and development takes place in IBMs Watson Research Center in Yorktown Heights, N.Y., the Center for Semiconductor Research at Albany NanoTech, and at IBMs 300-millimeter manufacturing facility in East Fishkill, N.Y.
research and development
We conduct research and development activities for our graphics products, chipset products and products for consumer electronics devices at design centers located throughout the world, including in the United States, Canada, India, Finland and China. Due to the rapid pace of technological change in the graphics industry, our strategy is to focus on developing the newest generation of products that meet market and customer requirements on a timely basis so as to meet each market window.
research and development
Should we choose to build the facility, the State of New York is required to issue bonds or otherwise fund the project and related research and development in the amount of $650 million. Actual disbursement of funds occurs as we submit appropriate documentation verifying that expenditures on the project have been incurred. If we move forward with the project, we must complete the construction of the facility in accordance with the final plans and specifications approved in writing by the ESDC and must maintain business operations on the Luther Forest Technology Campus for a minimum of seven years after the date full employment at the facility is first achieved. Funds disbursed to us may be subject to repayment, in whole or part, if we do not attain and or maintain certain levels of employment for specified periods of time.
research and development
We expect Intel to maintain its dominant position and to continue to invest heavily in marketing, research and development, new manufacturing facilities and other technology companies. Intel has substantially greater financial resources than we do and accordingly spends substantially greater amounts on research and development and production capacity than we do. Moreover, Intel launched its quad-core multi-chip module processors during the fourth quarter of 2006. We commenced initial shipments of our first quad-core products for servers in August 2007 and for desktop PCs in November 2007. However, we did not ship significant volumes of these products in 2007, but we expect to ship in more significant volumes in the first half of 2008. To the extent Intel manufactures a significantly larger portion of its microprocessor products using more advanced process technologies, or introduces competitive new products into the market before we do, we may be more vulnerable to Intels aggressive marketing and pricing strategies for microprocessor products.
research and development
We cannot be certain that our substantial investments in research and development will lead to timely improvements in product designs or technology used to manufacture our products or that we will have sufficient resources to invest in the level of research and development that is required to remain competitive.
research and development
We make substantial investments in research and development for process technologies in an effort to design and manufacture leading-edge microprocessors. We also make substantial investments in research and development related to product designs, including new integrated platforms and our design initiative called Fusion, and we anticipate that we will continue to invest in research and development in the future. We cannot be certain that we will be able to develop, obtain or successfully implement leading-edge process technologies needed to manufacture future generations of our products profitably or on a timely basis or that our competitors will not develop new technologies, products or processes that render our products uncompetitive or obsolete. If new competitors, technological advances by existing competitors or other competitive factors require us to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated in our research and development efforts, our operating expenses would increase. If we are required to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated in research and development efforts without an increase in revenue, our operating results could decline. Moreover, in connection with the ATI acquisition, we committed to the Minister of Industry of Canada to increase total expenditures on research and development in Canada when compared to ATIs expenditures in this area in prior years. However, we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient resources to achieve planned investments in research and development or to otherwise maintain the level of investment in research and development that is required for us to remain competitive.
development cost
If this agreement were to be terminated, we would have to substantially increase our research and development activities internally, which could significantly increase our research and development costs, and we could experience delays or other setbacks in the development of new process technologies, any of which would materially adversely affect us. Moreover, the timely achievement of the milestones set forth in the joint development agreement is critical to our ability to continue to manufacture microprocessors using advanced process technologies.
research and development
If we are unable to comply with the covenants in the subsidy grant documents that we receive from the State of Saxony, the Federal Republic of Germany and/or the European Union for Fab 30, Fab 36 or other research and development projects we may undertake in Germany, we may forfeit or have to repay our subsidies, which could materially adversely affect us.
research and development
We receive capital investment grants and allowances from the State of Saxony and the Federal Republic of Germany for Fab 36. We have also received capital investment grants and allowances as well as interest subsidies from these governmental entities for Fab 30. From time to time, we also apply for and obtain subsidies from the State of Saxony, the Federal Republic of Germany and the European Union for certain research and development projects. The subsidy grant documents typically contain covenants that must be complied with, and noncompliance with the conditions of the grants, allowances and subsidies could result in the forfeiture of all or a portion of any future amounts to be received, as well as the repayment of all or a portion of amounts received to date. If we are unable to comply with any of the covenants in the grant documents, we could be materially adversely affected.

At December 29, 2007, we owned principal engineering, manufacturing, warehouse and administrative facilities located in the United States, Canada, China, Germany, Singapore and Malaysia. These facilities totaled approximately 3.6 million square feet. Of this amount, 2.2 million square feet were located in Dresden, Germany and were used primarily for wafer fabrication, research and development, and administrative offices.

Our main facility with respect to our graphics and chipset products and products for consumer electronics devices is located in Markham, Ontario, Canada. This facility consists of approximately 240,000 square feet of office and research and development space. We have a 50 percent interest in the joint venture company that owns this facility. We occupy five other facilities in Markham, Ontario that comprise over 265,000 square feet, including approximately 65,000 square-feet of manufacturing and warehouse space.

r&d
Of the total purchase price, approximately $416 million was allocated to in-process research and development (IPR&D) and was expensed in the fourth quarter of 2006. Projects that qualify as IPR&D represent those that have not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use at the time of the acquisition. These projects include development of next generation GPU, chipset, handheld and digital TV products. As of the date of acquisition, the estimated fair value of the projects for the Graphics and Chipsets segment was approximately $193 million ($122 million for graphics products and $71 million for chipset products) and we expect to incur an aggregate of approximately $113 million ($86 million for graphics products and $27 million for chipset products) to complete these projects over the two-year period that commenced October 25, 2006. As of the date of the acquisition, the estimated fair value of the projects for the Consumer Electronics segment was approximately $223 million, and we expect to incur aggregate costs of approximately $102 million to complete these projects over the two-year period that commenced October 25, 2006. Starting in the first quarter of 2007, in conjunction with the integration of ATIs operations, we reported operations related to our chipset products in our Computing Solutions segment.
r&d
The value assigned to IPR&D was determined using a discounted cash flow methodology, specifically an excess earnings approach, which estimates value based upon the discounted value of future cash flows expected to be generated by the in-process projects, net of all contributory asset returns. The approach includes consideration of the importance of each project to the overall development plan and estimating costs to develop the purchased IPR&D into commercially viable products. The revenue estimates used to value the purchased IPR&D were based on estimates of the relevant market sizes and growth factors, expected trends in technology and the nature and expected timing of new product introductions by ATI and its competitors.
r&d
The estimates used in valuing IPR&D were based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain, and as a result, actual results may differ from estimates.
research and development
In accordance with business combination accounting, we have allocated the purchase price of ATI to tangible and acquisition related intangible assets acquired, including in-process research and development, and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. These valuations require us to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to acquisition related intangible assets.
research and development
We made estimates of fair value of the ATI assets acquired and liabilities assumed using reasonable assumptions based on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired company. Critical estimates in valuing certain of the acquisition related intangible assets included but were not limited to: future expected cash flows from the sale of products, expected costs to develop in-process research and development projects into commercially viable products and estimated cash flows from the projects when completed; the markets awareness of the acquired companys brand and the acquired companys market position, as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired brand will continue to be used in the combined companys product portfolio and discount rates. Unanticipated events may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results as evidenced by the impairment charges we recorded with respect to goodwill and intangible assets resulting from the ATI acquisition.
research and development
Computing Solutions operating loss was $670 million in 2007 compared to operating income of $680 million in 2006. The operating loss was primarily due to the $665 million decrease in revenue described above, a $307 million increase in manufacturing expenses, a $309 million increase in research and development expenses and a $69 million increase in marketing, general and administrative expenses. Research and development expenses and marketing, general and administrative expenses increased for the reasons set forth under Expenses, below. Manufacturing expenses increased primarily due to increased volumes of microprocessors, a shift to higher-end microprocessors and the inclusion of ATIs chipset business in the Computing Solutions segment for a full year in 2007, as opposed to only nine weeks in 2006.
research and development
Computing Solutions operating income of $680 million in 2006 increased by $94 million, or 16 percent, compared to operating income of $586 million in 2005. This increase was primarily due to a 38 percent increase in net revenue, partially offset by an increase in manufacturing expenses of $856 million, an increase in marketing, general and administrative expenses of $265 million and an increase in research and development expenses of $219 million. Manufacturing expenses increased primarily to support higher sales volume. Research and development expenses and marketing, general and administrative expenses increased for the reasons set forth under Expenses, below.
research and development
All Other operating loss of $2.1 billion in 2007 increased by $1.4 billion compared to an operating loss of $720 million in 2006. The increase in operating loss was primarily attributable to ATI acquisition-related impairment charges of $1.6 billion, which included a goodwill write-down of $1.3 billion and a write-down of specific intangible assets of $349 million and an increase of $224 million in amortization of acquired intangible assets, partially offset by a decrease in ATI integration charges of $453 million. Integration charges in 2006 included $416 million in expenses for acquired in-process research and development, which did not recur in 2007. See Part II, Item 7 MD&AATI Acquisition.
research and development
All Other operating loss of $720 million in 2006 increased by $677 million compared to an operating loss of $43 million in 2005. The increase in operating loss was primarily attributable to ATI acquisition-related charges of $557 million and an increase in employee stock-based compensation expense and profit sharing expense of $104 million. ATI acquisition-related charges included an in-process research and development write-off of $416 million, amortization of acquired intangible assets of $47 million, cost of fair value adjustments to acquired inventory of $62 million and a $32 million charge associated with the integration of ATIs operations, which included termination of some AMD employees, cancellation of some existing contractual obligations and other costs that we incurred to integrate the operations of the two companies.

Research and Development Expenses
research and development
Research and development expenses increased $642 million, or 53 percent, from $1.2 billion in 2006 to $1.8 billion in 2007. The increase was primarily attributable to: a $309 million increase in research and development expenses attributable to our Computing Solutions segment, a $186 million increase in research and development expenses attributable to our Graphics segment and a $149 million increase in research and development expenses attributable to our Consumer Electronics segment. Research and development expenses attributable to our Computing Solutions segment increased due primarily to higher product design costs for our next generation microprocessor products. In addition, research and development expenses attributable to ATIs chipset business were included for the full year in 2007 compared to only nine weeks in 2006. Research and development expenses attributable to our Graphics and Consumer Electronics segments increased primarily due to the inclusion of operations related to these segments for the full fiscal year in 2007 compared to nine weeks in 2006.
development cost
Research and development expenses increased $61 million, or 5 percent, from $1.1 billion in 2005 to $1.2 billion in 2006. This increase was primarily attributable to: a $219 million increase in research and development expenses attributable to our Computing Solutions segment primarily due to an increase in silicon design, platform and product development costs for our microprocessor products partially offset by a $10 million lower corporate bonus expense, increases of $42 million and $31 million, respectively due to the consolidation of research and development expenses attributable to our Graphics and Consumer Electronics segments from October 25, 2006 through December 31, 2006, and a $51 million increase in stock-based compensation and profit sharing expenses. Fiscal 2006 research and development expenses were partially offset by the absence of research and development expenses related to Spansions operations because we did not consolidate Spansions results of operations into ours in 2006. In 2005, research and development expenses attributable to our Memory Products segment were $290 million.
research and development
From time to time, we also apply for and obtain subsidies from the State of Saxony, the Federal Republic of Germany and the European Union for certain research and development projects. We record the amortization of the research and development related grants and allowances, as well as the research and development subsidies, as a reduction of research and development expenses when all conditions and requirements set forth in the subsidy grant are met. The credit to research and development expenses totaled $30 million in 2007, $27 million in 2006, and $44 million in 2005.

In-process research and development charges of $416 million in 2006 related to projects acquired in connection with the acquisition of ATI. Amortization of acquired intangible assets and integration charges in 2006 included amortization of $47 million and integration charges of $32 million. See Part II, Item 7 MD&AATI Acquisition.
research and development
Net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $1.3 billion in 2006. Our net loss of $166 million was adjusted for non-cash charges consisting primarily of $837 million of depreciation and amortization expense, $416 million for the write-off of in-process research and development expenses related to the ATI acquisition, stock-based compensation expense of $77 million, and $45 million related to an equity interest in the net loss of Spansion. These charges were partially offset by amortization of foreign grants and subsidies of $151 million. The net changes in our operating assets at December 31, 2006 compared to December 25, 2005 included an increase of $530 million in accounts payable and accrued liabilities, partially offset by a decrease in payables to related parties of $229 million and an increase of $175 million in other assets. The increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities was primarily related to higher purchases of raw materials, technology license payment obligations, and marketing accruals due to increased operations in the Computing Solutions segment. The decrease in payables to related parties is a result of our no longer shipping products and invoicing customers on behalf of Spansion after the second quarter of 2006. Prior to the second quarter of 2006, we shipped products to and invoiced Spansions customers in our name on behalf of Spansion and remitted the receipts to Spansion. The increase in other assets was primarily due to purchases of new technology licenses.
research and development
In connection with the receipt of investment grants for the Fab 36 project, AMD Fab 36 KG is required to attain a certain employee headcount by December 2008 and is required to maintain this headcount through December 2013. We record these grants as long-term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet and amortize them to operations ratably starting from December 2004 through December 2013. Initially, we amortized the grant amounts as a reduction to research and development expenses. Beginning in the first quarter of 2006 when Fab 36 began producing revenue generating products, we started amortizing these amounts as a reduction to cost of sales. For allowances, starting from the first quarter of 2006, we amortize the amounts as a reduction of depreciation expense ratably over the life of the investments because these allowances are intended to subsidize the capital investments. Noncompliance with the covenants contained in the subsidy documents could result in the repayment of all or a portion of the amounts received to date.
research and development
In connection with the acquisition of ATI, we made several commitments to the Minister of Industry under the Investment Canada Act, including that we will: increase spending on research and development in Canada to a specified amount over the course of a three-year period when compared to ATIs expenditures in this area in prior years; maintain Canadian employee headcount at specified levels by the end of the three-year anniversary of the acquisition; increase by a specified amount the number of our Canadian employees focusing on research and development; attain specified Canadian capital expenditures over a three-year period; maintain a presence in Canada through a variety of commercial activities for a period of five years; and nominate a Canadian for election to our Board of Directors over the next five years. Our minimum required Canadian capital expenditures and research and development commitments are included in our aggregate unconditional purchase commitments.

(SFAS 141R). This statement retains the fundamental requirements of the original pronouncement requiring that the acquisition method of accounting, or purchase method, be used for all business combinations. SFAS 141R defines the acquirer as the entity that obtains control of one or more businesses in the business combination, establishes the acquisition date as the date that the acquirer achieves control and requires the acquirer to recognize the assets acquired, liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest at their fair values as of the acquisition date. In addition, SFAS 141R requires, among other things, expensing of acquisition-related and restructuring-related costs, measurement of pre-acquisition contingencies at fair value, measurement of equity securities issued for purchase at the date of close of the transaction and capitalization of in-process research and development, all of which represent modifications to current accounting for business combinations. SFAS 141R is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. Adoption is prospective and early adoption is not permitted. Adoption of SFAS 141R will not impact our accounting for business combinations closed prior to its adoption, but given the nature of the changes noted above, we expect our accounting for business combinations occurring subsequent to adoption will be significantly different than that applied following current accounting literature.

(SFAS 141R). This statement retains the fundamental requirements of the original pronouncement requiring that the acquisition method of accounting, or purchase method, be used for all business combinations. SFAS 141R defines the acquirer as the entity that obtains control of one or more businesses in the business combination, establishes the acquisition date as the date that the acquirer achieves control and requires the acquirer to recognize the assets acquired, liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest at their fair values as of the acquisition date. In addition, SFAS 141R requires, among other things, expensing of acquisition-related and restructuring-related costs, measurement of pre-acquisition contingencies at fair value, measurement of equity securities issued for purchase at the date of close of the transaction and capitalization of in-process research and development, all of which represent modifications to current accounting for business combinations. SFAS 141R is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. Adoption is prospective and early adoption is not permitted. Adoptions of SFAS 141R will not impact the Companys accounting for business combinations closed prior to its adoption, but given the nature of the changes noted above, the Company expects that its accounting for business combinations occurring subsequent to adoption will be significantly different than that applied following current accounting literature.

Of the total purchase price, approximately $416 million was allocated to in-process research and development (IPR&D) and was expensed in the fourth quarter of 2006. Projects that qualify as IPR&D represent those that have not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use at the time of the acquisition. These projects included development of next generation products for the Graphics and Chipsets segment and the Consumer Electronics segment. The estimated fair value of the projects for the Graphics and Chipsets segment was approximately $193 million ($122 million for graphics products and $71 million for chipset products). The estimated fair value of the projects for the Consumer Electronics segment was approximately $223 million. Starting in the first quarter of 2007, in conjunction with the integration of ATIs operations, the Company reported operations related to its chipset products in its Computing Solutions segment.

In connection with the receipt of investment grants for the Fab 36 project, AMD Fab 36 KG is required to attain a certain employee headcount by December 2008 and maintain this headcount through December 2013. The Company records these grants as long-term liabilities on the Companys consolidated balance sheet and amortize them to operations ratably starting from December 2004 through December 2013. Initially, the Company amortized the grant amounts as a reduction to research and development expenses. Beginning in the first quarter of 2006 when Fab 36 began producing revenue generating products, the Company started amortizing these amounts as a reduction to cost of sales. For allowances, starting from the first quarter of 2006, the Company amortizes the amounts as a reduction of depreciation expense ratably over the life of the investments because these allowances are intended to subsidize the capital investments. Noncompliance with the covenants contained in the subsidy documents could result in the repayment of all or a portion of the amounts received to date.

research and development
We expect Intel to maintain its dominant position in the microprocessor market and to continue to invest heavily in marketing, research and development, new manufacturing facilities and other technology companies. Intel has substantially greater financial resources than we do and accordingly spends substantially greater amounts on research and development and production capacity than we do. We expect intense competition from Intel to continue.
development cost
Other than Intel, our principal competitor is Nvidia Corporation, and to a lesser extent, Matrox Electronic Systems Ltd., Silicon Integrated Systems Corp. and Via Technologies, Inc. Other competitors include a number of smaller companies which may have greater flexibility to address specific market needs. However, we believe that the growing complexity of visual processors and the associated research and development costs represent an increasingly high barrier to entry in this market.

Our research and development expenses for 2006, 2005, and 2004 were $1,205 million, $1,144 million and $934 million. Research and development expenses for 2006 included ATIs research and development expenses from October 25, 2006 through December 31, 2006. For more information, see Part II, Item 7, MD&A.
research and development
We conduct product and system research and development activities for our microprocessor products in the United States with additional design and development engineering teams located in Germany, Singapore, China, Japan, Penang, Taiwan and India. In August 2006 we announced the opening of a new research and development facility in Shanghai, China. Also, in September 2006 we announced the opening of a new advanced microprocessor development facility in Fort Collins, Colorado.
research and development
We conduct our microprocessor manufacturing process development activities primarily through our joint development agreement with IBM. Under this agreement, we jointly develop new process technologies, including 45-nanometer, 32-nanometer, 22-nanometer and certain other advanced technologies, to be implemented on silicon wafers. Our relationship also includes laboratory-based research of emerging technologies such as new transistor, interconnect, lithography and die-to-package connection technologies. We pay fees to IBM for joint development projects. The actual amounts we pay to IBM are dependent upon the number of partners, including us and IBM, engaged in related development projects under the agreement. In addition, we agreed to pay IBM specified royalties upon the occurrence of specified events, including in the event that we sublicense the jointly developed process technologies to specified third parties or if we bump wafers for a third party. For more information on the fees paid or payable to IBM, see Part II, Item 7, Contractual Cash Obligations and GuaranteesUnconditional Purchase Commitments, and Part I, Item 1A, Risk FactorsWe cannot be certain that our substantial investments in research and development will lead to timely improvements in product designs or technology used to manufacture our products or that we will have sufficient resources to invest in the level of research and development that is required to remain competitive.
research and development
Under the agreement, our joint development relationship continues through December 31, 2011. However, the continuation of capital purchases by IBM necessary for process development projects under the agreement past December 31, 2008 is conditioned upon the approval of IBMs board of directors. If IBMs board of directors does not approve our agreement by September 30, 2007, either party has the right to terminate the agreement effective December 31, 2008 without liability. In addition, our agreement with IBM may be extended further by the mutual agreement of the parties and can also be terminated immediately by either party if the other party permanently ceases doing business, becomes bankrupt or insolvent, liquidates or undergoes a change of control or can be terminated by either party upon 30 days written notice upon a failure of the other party to perform a material obligation thereunder. Under our agreement, research and development takes place in IBMs Watson Research Center in Yorktown Heights, N.Y., the Center for Semiconductor Research at Albany NanoTech, and at IBMs 300-millimeter manufacturing facility in East Fishkill, N.Y.

We conduct research and development activities for our graphics and chipset products and products for consumer electronics devices at design centers located throughout the world, including in the United States,
research and development
Development Corporation d/b/a Empire State Development Corporation, or ESDC, in connection with a potential new 300-millimeter wafer fabrication facility on the Luther Forest Technology Campus in Saratoga County, New York. Under the agreement, AMD would be able to construct a new facility designed to produce 300-millimeter wafers using 32-nanometer process technology between July 2007 and July 2009. However, we are not obligated to commence construction, and our decision regarding proceeding with the construction is dependent on business conditions and market demand. Should we choose to build the facility, the State of New York is required to issue bonds or otherwise fund the project and related research and development in the amount of $650 million. Actual disbursement of funds occurs as we submit appropriate documentation verifying that expenditures on the project have been incurred. If we move forward with the project, we must complete the construction of the facility in accordance with the final plans and specifications approved in writing by ESDC and must maintain business operations on the Luther Forest Technology Campus for a minimum of seven years after the date full employment at the facility is first achieved. Funds disbursed to us may be subject to repayment, in whole or part, if we do not attain and or maintain certain levels of employment for specified periods of time.

We expect Intel to maintain its dominant position and to continue to invest heavily in marketing, research and development, new manufacturing facilities and other technology companies. Intel has substantially greater financial resources than we do and accordingly spends substantially greater amounts on research and development and production capacity than we do. Moreover, Intel currently manufactures a large portion of its processors using 65-nanometer technology whereas we only began commercial shipments of processors

We make substantial investments in research and development for process technologies in an effort to design and manufacture leading-edge microprocessors. We cannot be certain that we will be able to develop, obtain or successfully implement leading-edge process technologies needed to manufacture future generations of our products profitably or on a timely basis or that our competitors will not develop new technologies, products or processes that render our products uncompetitive or obsolete. We also make substantial investments in research and development related to product design and anticipate that we will continue to do so in the future. For example, we recently opened a research and development facility in Shanghai and an advanced microprocessor development facility in Fort Collins, Colorado. Similarly, in connection with the recent acquisition of ATI, we plan to continue to invest in research and development related to our graphics and chipset products and products for consumer electronics devices, including new integrated platforms and our design initiative called Fusion. Moreover, in connection with the acquisition, we committed to the Minister of Industry of Canada to increase total expenditures on research and development in Canada when compared to

Capital purchases by IBM necessary for the continued development of process development projects past December 31, 2008 are conditioned upon the approval by IBMs board of directors. If such approval is not received by September 30, 2007, either party has the right to terminate the agreement effective December 31, 2008 without liability. If this agreement were to be terminated, we would either have to resume certain research and development activities internally or find an alternate partner. In either case, our research and development costs could increase, and we could experience delays or other setbacks in the development of new process technologies, any of which would materially adversely affect us. Moreover, the timely achievement of the milestones set forth in the joint development agreement is critical to our ability to continue to manufacture microprocessors using advanced process technologies.

If we are unable to comply with the covenants in the subsidy grant documents that we receive from the State of Saxony, the Federal Republic of Germany and/or the European Union for Fab 30, Fab 36 or other research and development projects we may undertake in Germany, we may forfeit or have to repay our subsidies, which could materially adversely affect us.
research and development
We receive capital investment grants and allowances from the State of Saxony and the Federal Republic of Germany for Fab 36. We have also received capital investment grants and allowances as well as interest subsidies from these governmental entities for Fab 30. From time to time, we also apply for and obtain subsidies from the State of Saxony, the Federal Republic of Germany and the European Union for certain research and development projects. The subsidy grant documents typically contain covenants that must be complied with, and noncompliance with the conditions of the grants, allowances and subsidies could result in the forfeiture of all or a portion of any future amounts to be received, as well as the repayment of all or a portion of amounts received to date. If we are unable to comply with any of the covenants in the grant documents, we could be materially adversely affected.

In-Process Research and Development
r&d
Of the total purchase price, approximately $416 million was allocated to in-process research and development (IPR&D) and was expensed in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2006. Projects that qualify as IPR&D represent those that have not reached technological feasibility and have no alternative future use at the time of the acquisition. The value assigned to IPR&D was determined using a discounted cash flow methodology, specifically an excess earnings approach, which estimates value based upon the discounted value of future cash flows expected to be generated by the in-process projects, net of all contributory asset returns. The approach includes consideration of the importance of each project to the overall development plan, estimating costs to develop the purchased IPR&D into commercially viable products. The revenue estimates used to value the purchased IPR&D were based on estimates of the relevant market sizes and growth factors, expected trends in technology and the nature and expected timing of new product introductions by ATI and its competitors.
r&d
The estimates used in valuing these IPR&D were based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable, and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates.
research and development
In accordance with business combination accounting, we have allocated the purchase price of ATI to tangible and acquisition related intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed as well as to in-process research and development based on their estimated fair values. These valuations require us to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to acquisition related intangible assets.
research and development
We make estimates of fair value using reasonable assumptions based on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired company. Critical estimates in valuing certain of the acquisition related intangible assets include but are not limited to: future expected cash flows from sale of products, expected costs to develop in-process research and development projects into commercially viable products and estimated cash flows from the projects when completed; the markets awareness of the acquired companys brand and the acquired companys market position, as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired brand will continue to be used in the combined companys product portfolio; and discount rates. Unanticipated events may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results.

research and development
Computation Products operating income of $641 million in 2005 increased by $361 million, or 129 percent, compared to operating income of $280 million in 2004. This increase was primarily due to a 50 percent increase in net revenue whereas cost of sales increased by only 45 percent. Partially offsetting this increase was an increase in marketing, general and administrative expense of $199 million and an increase in research and development expenses of $203 million.
research and development
Embedded Products operating loss of $18 million in 2006 decreased $37 million as compared to an operating loss of $55 million in 2005. The decrease in operating loss was primarily due to a $20 million decrease in research and development expenses and $12 million in sales of products that we had previously written off.
research and development
All Other operating loss of $722 million in 2006 increased by $679 million compared to an operating loss of $43 million in 2005. The increase in operating loss was primarily attributable to ATI acquisition-related charges of $557 million and an increase in employee stock-based compensation expense and profit sharing expense of $104 million. The ATI acquisition-related charges include the in-process research and development write-off of $416 million, amortization of acquired intangible assets of $47 million, cost of fair value adjustments to acquired inventory of $62 million and a $32 million charge associated with the integration plan which included termination of some AMD employees, cancellation of some existing contractual obligations and other costs that we incurred to integrate the operations of the two companies.
research and development
Research and Development Expenses
development cost
Research and development expenses increased $61 million, or 5 percent, from $1,144 million in 2005 to $1,205 million in 2006. This increase was primarily attributable to: a $222 million increase in research and development expenses attributable to our Computation Products segment primarily due to an increase in silicon design, platform and product development costs for our microprocessor products, a $90 million increase due to the consolidation of ATIs research and development expenses from October 25, 2006, and a $39 million increase in stock-based compensation, corporate bonus and profit sharing expenses. Research and development expenses were partially offset by the absence of Spansion research and development expenses because we did not consolidate Spansions results of operations into ours in 2006. In 2005, research and development expenses attributable to our Memory Products segment were $290 million.
research and development
Research and development expenses increased $210 million, or 22 percent, from $934 million in 2004 to $1,144 million in 2005 primarily due to an increase of $103 million in product design and process improvement costs for new generations of our microprocessors and an increase in start-up costs associated with the Fab 36 project of $96 million.
research and development
From time to time, we also apply for and obtain subsidies from the State of Saxony, the Federal Republic of Germany and the European Union for certain research and development projects. We record the amortization of the research and development related grants and allowances as well as the research and development subsidies as a reduction of research and development expenses when all conditions and requirements set forth in the subsidy grant are met. The credit to research and development expenses totaled $27 million in 2006, $44 million in 2005, and $21 million in 2004.

The 2002 Restructuring Plan resulted in the consolidation of facilities, primarily at our Sunnyvale, California site and at sales offices worldwide. We vacated and are attempting to sublease certain facilities that we currently occupy under long-term operating leases through 2011. We also terminated the implementation of certain partially completed enterprise resource planning software and other information technology implementation activities, resulting in the abandonment of certain software, hardware and capitalized development costs.
research and development
We had Canadian federal and provincial tax operating loss carry-forwards of approximately $31 million. These losses expire in 2026. We also had Canadian investment tax credits of approximately $139 million. $72 million of these investment tax credits expires in 2012 and 2013 with the remainder expiring by 2026. We also had Canadian federal and provincial research and development pools of $523 million and $275 million, respectively, which are not subject to expiration.
research and development
Net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $1.3 billion in 2006. Net loss of $166 million was adjusted for non-cash charges consisting primarily of $837 million of depreciation and amortization expense, $416 million for the write-off of in-process research and development expenses related to the ATI acquisition, stock-based compensation expense of $77 million, and $45 million related to an equity interest in the net loss of Spansion. These charges were offset by amortization of foreign grants and subsidies of $151 million. The net changes in operating assets at December 31, 2006 compared to December 25, 2005 included a decrease in payables to related parties of $229 million because we no longer ship products and invoice customers on behalf of Spansion. Prior to the second quarter of 2006, we shipped products to and invoiced Spansions customers in our name on behalf of Spansion and remitted the receipts to Spansion. The increase in other assets was primarily due to purchases of new technology licenses. The increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $530 million was primarily related to higher purchases of raw materials, future payment of technology licenses, and marketing accruals due to increased operations in the Computation Products segment.
research and development
In connection with the receipt of subsidies for the Fab 36 project, AMD Fab 36 KG is required to attain a certain employee headcount by December 2007 and maintain this headcount through December 2012. We record the subsidies as long-term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet and amortize them to operations ratably starting from December 2004 through December 2012. Initially, we amortized the grant amounts as a reduction to research and development expenses. Beginning in the first quarter of 2006 when Fab 36 began producing revenue generating products, we started amortizing these amounts as a reduction to cost of sales. For allowances, starting from the first quarter of 2006, we amortize the amounts as a reduction of depreciation expense ratably

In connection with the receipt of subsidies for the Fab 36 project, AMD Fab 36 KG is required to attain a certain employee headcount by December 2007 and maintain this headcount through December 2012. The Company recorded these subsidies as long-term liabilities on its consolidated balance sheets and amortizes them to operations ratably starting from December 2004 through December 2012. Initially, the Company amortized the grant amounts as a reduction to research and development expenses. Beginning in the first quarter of 2006, when Fab 36 began producing revenue generating products, the Company started amortizing these amounts as a reduction to cost of sales. For allowances, starting from the first quarter of 2006, the Company amortizes the amounts as a reduction of depreciation expense ratably over the life of the equipment because these allowances are intended to subsidize the capital investments in equipment. Noncompliance with the covenants contained in the subsidy grant documents could result in forfeiture of all or a portion of the future amounts to be received, as well as the repayment of all or a portion of amounts received to date.

We expect Intel to maintain its dominant position in the microprocessor market and to continue to invest heavily in research and development, new manufacturing facilities and other technology companies. Intel has substantially greater financial resources than we do and accordingly spends substantially greater amounts on research and development and production capacity than we do. We expect competition from Intel to continue and increase in the future to the extent Intel reduces the prices for its products and as Intel introduces new competitive products.

research and development
We focus our research and development activities on product design and system and manufacturing process development. We have devoted significant resources to product design and to developing and improving manufacturing process technologies. We also work with other industry leaders as well as public foundations, universities and industry consortia to conduct early stage research and development. For example, we conduct our microprocessor manufacturing process development primarily through our joint development agreement with IBM. We are also a joint venture partner with Infineon Technologies AG and Toppan Printing Co., Ltd. for research and development related to optical photomasks that we use during microprocessor manufacturing. We are also a member with Infineon, the Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft research institution, the German Ministry of Education and Research and the Free State of Saxony in the Fraunhofer Center for Nanoelectronic Technology, the CNT, in Dresden, Germany. The CNT is a joint development effort that conducts research and development projects that focus on developing improvements in semiconductor processing technology particularly on 300-millimeter technology.
research and development
We are currently focusing on delivering the next generation of microprocessors and on advanced manufacturing process technologies, including implementing 65-nanometer technology and continuing development of our 45-nanometer technology. In order to remain competitive, we must continue to maintain our technology leadership. As of December 25, 2005, our total research and development staff consisted of approximately 2,700 employees. Because Spansions IPO closed on December 21, 2005, Spansions research and development staff is not included in the number of employees listed above. Our research and development expenses for 2005, 2004, and 2003 were $1,144 million, $935 million and $852 million. For more information, see Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations.
research and development
We conduct product and system research and development activities for our microprocessor products in the United States with additional design and development engineering teams located in Germany, China, Japan and India. In December 2005, we announced the opening of the Korea Technology Development Center. The center will focus on helping local customers and partners develop customized embedded processor platforms for various digital consumer devices, including WiBro terminals, digital media broadcast solutions, personal media players, HDTV and Internet access solutions.

The agreement also extended the joint development relationship for an additional three years, from December 31, 2008 to December 31, 2011. However, the continuation of capital purchases by IBM necessary for process development projects under the agreement past December 31, 2008 is conditioned upon the approval of IBMs board of directors. If IBMs board of directors does not approve this agreement by September 30, 2007, either party has the right to terminate the agreement effective December 31, 2008 without liability. In addition, the agreement may be extended further by the mutual agreement of the parties and can also be terminated immediately by either party if the other party permanently ceases doing business, becomes bankrupt or insolvent, liquidates or undergoes a change of control or can be terminated by either party upon 30 days written notice upon a failure of the other party to perform a material obligation thereunder. Under this agreement, research and development takes place in IBMs Watson Research Center in Yorktown Heights, New York, the Center for Semiconductor Research at Albany NanoTech, and at IBMs 300 millimeter manufacturing facility in East Fishkill, N.Y.

development cost
Computation Products operating income of $617 million in 2005 increased by 132 percent compared to operating income of $266 million in 2004. The increase was primarily due to a 50 percent increase in net sales, partially offset by a 36 percent increase in operating expenses. Operating expenses increased $914 million primarily due to a 37 percent increase in unit shipments, an increase of $205 million in research and development costs, and an increase of $110 million in marketing and cooperative advertising costs. The increase in research and development costs was due primarily to an increase of $103 million in product design and process improvement costs for new generations of our microprocessors and a $96 million increase in Fab 36 start-up costs.
development cost
Computation Products operating income of $266 million in 2004 increased by $298 million compared to an operating loss of $32 million in 2003. The increase was primarily due to a 29 percent increase in net sales, partially offset by a 14 percent increase in operating expenses. Operating expenses increased due primarily to an increase in marketing and cooperative advertising costs of $79 million in connection with our AMD64-based processors, a nine percent increase in unit shipments, and a $28 million increase in research and development costs. The increase in research and development costs was due primarily to a $29 million increase in Fab 36 start-up costs and a $24 million increase in product design and engineering costs related to future generations of our microprocessors offset by a $23 million decrease in Fab 30 research and development activities.

Research and Development Expenses
research and development
Research and development expenses of $1,144 million in 2005 increased 22 percent from $935 million in 2004 due primarily to an increase of $103 million in product design and process improvement costs for new generations of our microprocessors and increased start-up costs associated with the Fab 36 project of $96 million.
research and development
Research and development expenses of $935 million in 2004 increased ten percent from $852 million in 2003 due in part to higher research and development expenses as a result of the consolidation of Spansion LLCs results of operations with our results of operations effective June 30, 2003, increased start-up costs associated with the Fab 36 project of approximately $29 million and a $24 million increase in product design and engineering costs for new generations of our microprocessors. These factors were partially offset by a $23 million decrease in Fab 30 research and development activities.
research and development
From time to time, we also apply for and obtain subsidies from the State of Saxony, the Federal Republic of Germany and the European Union for certain research and development projects. We record the amortization of the research and development related grants and allowances as well as the research and development subsidies as a reduction of research and development expenses when all conditions and requirements set forth in the subsidy grant are met. The credit to research and development expenses totaled $44 million in 2005, $21 million in 2004 and $29 million in 2003.

The 2002 Restructuring Plan resulted in the consolidation of facilities, primarily at our Sunnyvale, California site and at sales offices worldwide. We vacated and are attempting to sublease certain facilities currently occupied under long-term operating leases through 2011. We also terminated the implementation of certain partially completed enterprise resource planning (ERP) software and other information technology implementation activities, resulting in the abandonment of certain software, hardware and capitalized development costs.

In connection with the receipt of subsidies for the Fab 36 project, AMD Fab 36 KG is required to attain a certain employee headcount by December 2007 and maintain this headcount through December 2012. We record the subsidies as long-term liabilities on our financial statements and amortize them to operations ratably starting from December 2004 through December 2012. Currently, we amortize the grant amounts as a reduction to research and development expenses. At such time as Fab 36 begins producing revenue-generating products, which is expected to be in the first quarter of 2006, we will amortize these amounts as a reduction to cost of sales. For allowances, we will amortize the amounts as a reduction of depreciation expense ratably over the life of the equipment, starting from the first quarter of 2006 because these allowances are intended to subsidize the capital investments in equipment. Noncompliance with the covenants contained in the subsidy grant documents could result in forfeiture of all or a portion of the future amounts to be received, as well as the repayment of all or a portion of amounts received to date.
research and development
Also, during the first quarter of 2006, we expect operating expenses, which include research and development expenses and marketing, sales and administrative expenses, to increase by approximately 6 percent from comparable operating expenses in the fourth quarter of 2005, which excludes those operating expenses related to the Memory Products segment.
research and development
We expect Intel to maintain its dominant position in the microprocessor market and to continue to invest heavily in marketing, research and development, new manufacturing facilities and other technology companies.
research and development
Intel has substantially greater financial resources than we do and accordingly spends substantially greater amounts on research and development and production capacity than we do. Moreover, Intel currently manufactures certain of its microprocessor products on 300-millimeter wafers using 65-nanometer process technology whereas we expect to make our first production shipments of products manufactured on 300-millimeter wafers using 90-nanometer process technology in the first quarter of 2006. We expect to begin commercial shipments of microprocessors manufactured using 65-nanometer technology by the end of 2006. To the extent Intel manufactures its microprocessor products on larger wafers and smaller process technologies earlier than we do, we may be more vulnerable to Intels aggressive marketing and pricing strategies for microprocessor products, which may result in market share gains for Intel. Intels dominant position in the microprocessor market, its existing relationships with top-tier OEMs and its aggressive marketing and pricing strategies could result in lower unit sales and average selling prices for our products, which could have a material adverse effect on us.

We cannot be certain that our substantial investments in research and development of process technologies will lead to timely improvements in technology and equipment used to fabricate our products or that we will have sufficient resources to invest in the level of research and development that is required to remain competitive.
research and development
We make substantial investments in research and development for process technologies in an effort to design and manufacture leading-edge microprocessors. We cannot be certain that we will be able to develop, obtain or successfully implement leading-edge process technologies needed to manufacture future generations of our products profitably or on a timely basis or that our competitors will not develop new technologies, products or processes that render our products uncompetitive or obsolete. Furthermore, we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient resources to maintain the level of investment in research and development that is required for us to remain competitive.
research and development
For example, we have a joint development agreement with IBM, pursuant to which we have agreed to work together to develop new process technologies through December 31, 2011. However, capital purchases by IBM necessary for the continued development of process development projects past December 31, 2008 are conditioned upon the approval by IBMs board of directors. If such approval is not received by September 30, 2007, either party has the right to terminate the agreement effective December 31, 2008 without liability. We anticipate that under this agreement, from December 25, 2005 through December 25, 2011, we would pay fees to IBM of between $502 million and $562 million in connection with joint development projects. In addition, from the beginning of 2002 through December 25, 2005, we paid $339 million to IBM in connection with agreements and services related to license grants and research and development activities.
development cost
If this agreement were to be terminated, we would either have to resume certain research and development activities internally or find an alternate partner. In either case, our research and development costs could increase, and we could experience delays or other setbacks in the development of new process technologies, any of which would materially adversely affect us. Moreover, the timely achievement of the milestones set forth in the joint development agreement is critical to our ability to continue to manufacture microprocessors at Fab 36 using advanced process technologies.
research and development
If we are unable to comply with the covenants in the subsidy grant documents that we receive from the State of Saxony, the Federal Republic of Germany and/or the European Union for Fab 30, Fab 36 or other research and development projects we may undertake in Germany, we may forfeit or have to repay our subsidies, which could materially adversely affect us.

subsidies from these governmental entities for Fab 30. From time to time, we also apply for and obtain subsidies from the State of Saxony, the Federal Republic of Germany and the European Union for certain research and development projects. The subsidy grant documents typically contain covenants that must be complied with, and noncompliance with the conditions of the grants, allowances and subsidies could result in the forfeiture of all or a portion of any future amounts to be received, as well as the repayment of all or a portion of amounts received to date. If we are unable to comply with any of the covenants in the grant documents, we may be materially adversely affected.

We expect Intel to maintain its dominant position in the microprocessor market and to continue to invest heavily in research and development, new manufacturing facilities and other technology companies. Intel has substantially greater financial resources than we do and accordingly spends substantially greater amounts on research and development and production capacity than we do. We expect competition from Intel to continue and increase in the future to the extent Intel reduces the prices for its products and as Intel introduces new competitive products. For example, in 2004, Intel introduced a 64-bit processor for servers and workstations that runs existing 32-bit software applications. These processors compete with our AMD Opteron microprocessors. In addition, Intel recently announced that it will offer dual-core 64-bit processors for the desktop market in the second quarter of 2005. Moreover, Intel currently manufactures certain of its microprocessor products on 300-millimeter wafers using 90-nanometer process technology, which can result in products that are higher performing, use less power and cost less to manufacture. We are currently transitioning to 90-nanometer process technology for microprocessor manufacturing, and we expect to transition to using 300-millimeter wafers in 2006.

We conduct product and system research and development activities for our microprocessor products in the United States with additional design and development engineering teams located in Germany, China, Japan and India. With respect to process development, some research and development takes place at Fab 30. We also have a joint development agreement with IBM pursuant to which we work together to develop new microprocessor process technologies to be implemented on silicon wafers. On September 15, 2004, we amended our joint development agreement and extended the relationship for an additional three years, from December 31, 2005 to December 31, 2008. Under the amended development agreement, we agreed to continue to develop jointly new microprocessor process technologies. In addition, we received a license from IBM to have our products made in 90-nanometer and 65-nanometer at a third-party foundry or a joint manufacturing facility owned by us and a third-party foundry. The development agreement may be extended further by the mutual agreement of the parties, and can also be terminated immediately by either party if the other party permanently ceases doing business, becomes bankrupt or insolvent, liquidates or undergoes a change of control, or can be terminated by either party upon 30 days written notice upon a failure of the other party to perform a material obligation thereunder.

development cost
Computation Products operating income of $303 million in 2004 increased by $326 million compared to an operating loss of $23 million in 2003. The increase was primarily due to a 29 percent increase in net sales, partially offset by a 12 percent increase in operating expenses. Operating expenses increased due primarily to an increase in marketing and cooperative advertising costs of $79 million in connection with our AMD64-based products, a nine percent increase in unit shipments, and a $28 million increase in research and development costs. The increase in research and development costs was due primarily to a $29 million increase in Fab 36 start-up costs and a $24 million increase in silicon design related to future generations of our microprocessors offset by a $23 million decrease in Fab 30 research and development activities.
research and development
expenses increased due to an increase of approximately $35 million in manufacturing costs as a result of a change in product mix, and an aggregate increase of $14 million in research and development expenses and marketing, general and administrative expenses as a result of activities related to our AMD Geode products and other product development. Manufacturing costs increased primarily because we manufactured more AMD Geode products, which generally are more expensive to manufacture than our other embedded processors.

Research and development expense
research and development
We amortize capital grants and allowances, interest subsidies and research and development subsidies that we receive from the State of Saxony and the Federal Republic of Germany for Fab 30 as they are earned. The amortization of these grants and subsidies is recognized as a credit to research and development expenses and cost of sales. The credit to cost of sales totaled $67.1 million in 2004, $46.2 million in 2003 and $37.5 million in 2002.
development cost
Research and development expenses of $935 million in 2004 increased ten percent from $852 million in 2003 due in part to higher research and development expenses as result of the consolidation of Spansions results of operation, an increase in start-up costs of approximately $29 million associated with the Fab 36 project and a $24 million increase in silicon design related to future generations of our microprocessors. These factors were partially offset by a $23 million decrease in Fab 30 research and development activities. Research and development expenses of $852 million in 2003 increased four percent from $816 million in 2002, due in part to higher research and development expenses as a result of the consolidation of Spansions results of operation, $23 million in research and development efforts related to new microprocessors, and $58 million paid to IBM to jointly develop new process technologies for use in future microprocessor products. The increases in research and development expenses were offset by a $35 million reduction in research and development costs, primarily due to the reduction of research and development activities associated with our PCS products and the absence of the $42 million charge representing amounts paid to IBM in 2002 in exchange for consulting services relating to optimizing the performance of our manufacturing processes.

The 2002 Restructuring Plan resulted in the consolidation of facilities, primarily at our Sunnyvale, California site and at sales offices worldwide. We vacated and are attempting to sublease certain facilities currently occupied under long-term operating leases through 2011. We also terminated the implementation of certain partially completed enterprise resource planning (ERP) software and other information technology implementation activities, resulting in the abandonment of certain software, hardware and capitalized development costs.

Of these amounts, AMD Saxony received approximately $411 million in capital investment grants and allowances and $153 million in interest subsidies through December 26, 2004. AMD Saxony also received $58 million in research and development subsidies through December 26, 2004. Amounts received under the Subsidy Agreement are recorded as a long-term liability on our financial statements and are amortized to operations ratably over the contractual life of the Subsidy Agreement as a reduction to operating expenses. As of December 26, 2004, these amounts were being amortized ratably through December 2007. AMD Saxony has received substantially all investment grants and allowances and interest subsidies to which it is entitled. Noncompliance with the conditions of the grants, allowances and subsidies contained in the Subsidy Agreement could result in the forfeiture of all or a portion of the future amounts to be received, as well as the repayment of all or a portion of amounts received to date.

In fiscal 2005, we expect capital expenditures of approximately $1.5 billion. We expect depreciation and amortization expense to be approximately $1.2 billion, and research and development expenses, both in total dollars and as a percentage of sales, to increase primarily due to Fab 36 start-up costs of approximately $200 million. We also expect total marketing, general and administrative expenses to increase in 2005, but to decline as a percentage of sales.

We cannot be certain that our substantial investments in research and development of process technologies will lead to timely improvements in technology and equipment used to fabricate our products or that we will have sufficient resources to invest in the level of research and development that is required to remain competitive.
research and development
We make substantial investments in research and development for process technologies in an effort to design and manufacture leading-edge microprocessors. We cannot be certain that we will be able to develop, or obtain or successfully implement leading-edge process technologies needed to manufacture future generations of our products profitably or on a timely basis. Furthermore, we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient resources to maintain the level of investment in research and development that is required for us to remain competitive.
research and development
For example, we have a joint development agreement with IBM, pursuant to which we work together to develop new process technologies. In September 2004, we amended this agreement and extended its termination date from December 2005 to December 2008. Under this amended agreement, we anticipate that from December 26, 2004 through December 2008, we would pay fees to IBM of between approximately $220 million and $250 million in connection with joint development projects. In addition, from the beginning of 2002 through December 26, 2004, we paid approximately $247 million to IBM in connection with agreements and services related to license grants and research and development activities.
development cost
If this agreement were to be terminated, we would either have to resume research and development activities for microprocessors internally or find an alternative partner. In either case, our research and development costs could increase, and we could experience delays or other setbacks in the development of new process technologies, any of which could materially adversely affect us. Moreover, the successful and timely development and implementation of silicon-on-insulator technology and the achievement of other milestones set forth in the joint development agreement are critical to our AMD64-based processors and to our ability to commence operations at Fab 36 in accordance with our planned schedule.
research and development
We expect Intel to maintain its dominant position in the microprocessor market, to continue to be a significant competitor in the Flash memory market and to continue to invest heavily in research and development, new manufacturing facilities and other technology companies. Intel has substantially greater financial resources than we do and accordingly spends substantially greater amounts on research and development and production capacity than we do. We also expect competition from Intel to increase to the extent Intel reduces prices on its microprocessor and/or Flash memory products and introduces new competitive products. For example, in 2004 Intel introduced a 64-bit processor for servers and workstations that runs existing 32-bit software applications. This processor competes with our AMD Opteron microprocessor. In addition, Intel recently announced that it will offer dual-core 64-bit processors for the desktop market in the second quarter of 2005. Moreover, Intel currently manufactures certain of its microprocessor products on 300-millimeter wafers using 90-nanometer process technology, which can result in products that are higher performing, use less power and cost less to manufacture. We are currently completing our transition to 90-nanometer process technology for microprocessor manufacturing, and we expect to transition to 300-millimeter wafers in 2006. To the extent Intel manufactures its microprocessor products on larger wafers and smaller process technologies earlier than we do, we may be more vulnerable to Intels aggressive pricing strategies for microprocessor products. Intels dominant position in the microprocessor market, its existing relationships with top-tier OEMs and its aggressive pricing strategies could result in lower unit sales and average selling prices for our products, which could have a material adverse effect on us.

The Company also contributed its Flash memory inventory, its manufacturing facility located in Austin, Texas (Fab 25), its Flash memory research and development facility in Sunnyvale, California, and its Flash memory assembly and test facilities in Thailand, Malaysia and Suzhou, China to Spansion LLC. The Company recorded its continuing 60 percent interest in these net assets at their historical carrying values. The remaining 40 percent interest in these net assets was treated as being sold to Fujitsu and, accordingly, 40 percent of the carrying values of these net assets were adjusted to and recorded based on the net assets fair value on the effective date of the transaction. During the fourth quarter of 2003, the Company completed its determination of the fair value of the assets and liabilities of Spansion LLC. The excess of the fair value of the net assets treated as sold over their historical carrying value was approximately $57 million. However, the gain of approximately six million dollars recognized by the Company and recorded in interest income and other, net, was limited to the excess of the fair value of the consideration received by the Company in the form of the Companys 60 percent equity interest in Fujitsus contributions and the incremental 10.008 percent interest in the former Manufacturing Joint Ventures net assets less direct costs of the transaction, over the 40 percent interest in the book value of the net assets contributed by the Company to Spansion LLC.

As part of the transaction, the Company and Fujitsu entered into various service contracts with Spansion LLC. The Company will continue to provide, among other things, certain information technology, facilities, logistics, legal, tax, finance, human resources, and environmental health and safety services to Spansion LLC. Under these contracts, Fujitsu will provide, among other things, certain information technology, research and development, quality assurance, insurance, facilities, environmental, and human resources services primarily to Spansion LLCs manufacturing facilities in Japan. Fees earned by the Company and incurred by Spansion LLC for these services are eliminated in consolidation.

The intangible assets recorded consist of the estimated fair value of the manufacturing and product distribution contracts between Spansion LLC and the Company and Spansion LLC and Fujitsu, which are determined to have an estimated useful life of four years, as well as the estimated fair value of the assembled work force, which is reflected as goodwill. No value was assigned to in-process research and development because the Company and Fujitsu performed all research and development activities for the Manufacturing Joint Venture, and the Company and Fujitsu did not convey in-process technology rights to Spansion LLC. Additionally, Spansion LLC pays intellectual property royalties to the Company and Fujitsu for technological know-how used in its business operations at royalty rates deemed to approximate fair market values. No additional intangible assets were identified in connection with the transaction.

In addition, in order to respond more quickly to changes in market trends in the Flash memory market and improve efficiencies in the production, marketing and design of our Flash memory products, we and Fujitsu Limited formed a new entity named FASL LLC, effective June 30, 2003. We own 60 percent of FASL LLC while Fujitsu owns 40 percent. Accordingly, as of June 30, 2003, we began consolidating the results of FASL LLCs operations. FASL LLC is headquartered in Sunnyvale, California, and its manufacturing, research, test, and assembly operations are in the United States and Asia. FASL LLC engages in the research, development, manufacture, marketing, and promotion of Flash memory products, which it markets under the Spansion global product brand name. We and Fujitsu are the distributors of FASL LLCs Spansion Flash memory products. As part of this transaction, we contributed to FASL LLC our Flash memory inventory, our manufacturing facility located in Austin, Texas, known as Fab 25, our Flash memory research and development facility in Sunnyvale, California, known as the Submicron Development Center, or SDC, and our Flash memory assembly and test operations in Thailand, Malaysia and China. Fujitsu contributed its Flash memory division, including related inventory, cash, and its Flash memory assembly and test operations in Malaysia. In addition, both we and Fujitsu contributed our respective investments in our previous manufacturing joint venture, Fujitsu AMD Semiconductor Limited, located in Aizu-Wakamatsu, Japan, which became part of a wholly owned subsidiary of FASL LLC named FASL JAPAN LIMITED, or FASL JAPAN. In this report we refer to the previous manufacturing joint venture with Fujitsu as the Manufacturing Joint Venture.

In December 2002, we executed an agreement with IBM to jointly develop new logic process technologies, particularly 65- and 45-nanometer technologies to be implemented on 300-millimeter silicon wafers, for use in producing future high-performance microprocessor products. The joint development agreement terminates on December 31, 2005 and may be extended by the mutual agreement of the parties. The agreement can also be terminated immediately by either party if the other party permanently ceases doing business, becomes bankrupt or insolvent, liquidates or undergoes a change of control, or terminated upon 30 days written notice upon a failure to perform a material obligation thereunder. The new process technologies are being developed at an IBM facility in New York and are aimed at improving microprocessor performance and reducing power consumption. The new process technologies will be based on advanced structures and materials such as high-speed SOI transistors, copper interconnects and improved low-k dielectric insulation. During 2002 and 2003, we paid approximately $190 million to IBM in connection with agreements and services related to research and development activities. In addition, in December 2003, we entered into license and consulting services agreements with IBM pursuant to which we licensed technology and know-how developed by IBM in connection with manufacturing products on 300-millimeter silicon wafers. In addition, some development work for logic process technologies took place at Fab 30. Research and development with respect to non-volatile memory technology used for manufacturing Spansion Flash memory products is conducted primarily at FASL LLCs SDC facility located in Sunnyvale, California and at its facilities in Japan. Currently, FASL LLC is developing new non-volatile memory process technology, including 90-nanometer floating gate technology and 90-nanometer MirrorBit technology utilizing three-layer copper interconnect.

We expect Intel to maintain its dominant position in the microprocessor market and to continue to invest heavily in research and development, new manufacturing facilities and other technology companies. Intel has substantially greater financial resources than we do and accordingly spends substantially greater amounts on research and development than we do. We expect competition from Intel to increase in 2004 and beyond to the extent Intel reduces the prices for its products and as Intel introduces new products. For example, in February 2004, Intel announced that it intends to introduce 64-bit processors for servers and workstations that will be able to run existing 32-bit software applications in mid-2004. We believe that these processors will compete with our AMD Opteron microprocessors. In addition, Intel announced that it will offer 64-bit processors for the desktop market and other market segments that will be able to run existing 32-bit software applications in a time frame based on both timing and availability of the infrastructure required to support them, and customer demand. These products would compete with our AMD Athlon 64 microprocessors. Moreover, Intel currently manufactures certain of its microprocessor products on 300-millimeter wafers using 90-nanometer process technology. Use of 90-nanometer technology can result in products that are higher performing, use less power and that cost less to manufacture. Use of 300-millimeter wafers can decrease manufacturing costs and increase capacity by yielding more equivalent chips per wafer than 200-millimeter wafers. We have not yet made comparable transitions at our microprocessor manufacturing facilities. As a result, we may be more vulnerable to Intels aggressive pricing strategies for microprocessor products. Intels strong position in the microprocessor market, its existing relationships with top-tier OEMs and its aggressive pricing strategies could result in lower unit sales and average selling prices for our products, which could adversely affect our revenues.

Research and development expenses of $852 million in 2003 increased four percent from $816 million in 2002 due primarily to an increase in expenses as a result of the FASL LLC transaction, $23 million in research and development efforts related to new microprocessors, and $58 million in expenses related to amounts paid to IBM to jointly develop new logic process technologies for use in future high-performance microprocessor products. These increases were offset by a $35 million reduction in internal research and development costs from 2002 to 2003, primarily due to the reduction of research and development activities associated with our PCS products and the absence of the $42 million charge representing amounts paid to IBM in 2002 in exchange for consulting services relating to optimizing the performance of our manufacturing processes.

In January 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (FIN 46). Variable interest entities are often created for a single specified purpose, for example, to facilitate securitization, leasing, hedging, research and development, or other transactions or arrangements. In December 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46 (revised December 2003) (FIN 46R) which replaces FIN 46. This interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51, Consolidated Financial Statements, defines what these variable interest entities are and provides guidelines on identifying them and assessing an enterprises interests in a variable interest entity to decide whether to consolidate that entity. FIN 46R applies at different dates to different types of enterprises and entities, and special provisions apply to enterprises that have fully or partially applied FIN 46 prior to issuance of FIN 46R. Generally, application of FIN 46R is required in financial statements of public entities that have interests in variable interest entities or potential variable interest entities commonly referred to as special-purpose entities for periods ending after December 15, 2003. Application by public entities for all other types of entities is required in financial statements for periods ending after March 15, 2004.

For example, in December 2002, we changed our logic process development strategy and entered into an agreement with IBM to jointly develop new logic process technologies for use in future high-performance microprocessor products. As a result of this agreement, we are ramping down silicon processing associated with logic research and development in our Submicron Development Center (SDC) in Sunnyvale, California and will be moving this work to IBMs facility in East Fishkill, New York. In addition, in June 2002 we entered into a joint venture alliance with Infineon Technologies and Dupont Photomasks to construct and operate an advanced research and development and pilot line photomask facility in Dresden, Germany.

Our expenses for research and development were $816 million in 2002, $651 million in 2001 and $642 million in 2000. These expenses represented 30 percent of sales in 2002, 17 percent of net sales in 2001 and 14 percent of net sales in 2000.
research and development
Research and development is conducted at our SDC, a 42,000 square-foot facility located in Sunnyvale, California. In addition, some development work takes place at our Fab 25 and Fab 30 manufacturing facilities. In 2003, we expect that silicon processing associated with research and development for logic process technologies will move to IBMs New York facility. Research and development with respect to our non-volatile memory technology used for manufacturing our Flash memory products will continue to be conducted at our SDC.

Gross margin percentage decreased to 22 percent in 2002 compared to 33 percent in 2001. This decrease was primarily due to decreased sales of both PC processors and Flash memory devices as a result of lower unit demand and average selling prices, partially offset by cost savings realized from the closure of certain facilities pursuant to the 2001 restructuring plan (discussed below) and the reallocation of certain manufacturing resources to research and development activities for new microprocessor products.
research and development
Research and development expenses of $816 million in 2002 increased 25 percent compared to 2001. This increase was primarily due to the reallocation of manufacturing resources, previously included in costs of goods sold, to research and development activities for new microprocessors. In addition, research and development expenses in 2002 included a $42 million charge for amounts paid to a third party in exchange for product development services provided in connection with a discrete PC processor research and development project in the fourth quarter of 2002.
research and development
Research and development expenses and cost of sales in 2002 included the recognition of $21.8 and $37.5 million of deferred credits on foreign capital grants, interest subsidies and research and development subsidies that were received from the State of Saxony for Fab 30. In 2001, these credits totaled $26.4 and $35.5 million. In 2000, these credits totaled $19.8 and $34.3 million.
research and development
Research and development expenses of $651 million in 2001 increased slightly compared to 2000. This slight increase was due to increased costs related to research and development activities for PC processors.
research and development
In December 2002, we finalized a restructuring plan (the 2002 Plan) to align our cost structure to current industry conditions resulting from weak customer demand and industry wide excess inventory. The 2002 Plan will result in the reduction of approximately 2,000 positions or 15 percent of our employees, affecting all levels of our workforce in almost every organization. As a result of our agreement with IBM, we are ramping down silicon processing associated with logic research and development in our SDC and will eliminate most of those related resources, including the sale or abandonment of certain equipment used in the SDC.
development cost
The 2002 Plan will also result in the consolidation of facilities, primarily at our Sunnyvale, California site and at sales offices worldwide. We are vacating, and attempting to sublease, certain facilities currently occupied under long-term operating leases. We have also terminated the implementation of certain partially completed enterprise resource planning (ERP) software and other information technology implementation activities, resulting in the abandonment of certain software, hardware and capitalized development costs.

Of these amounts, AMD Saxony received approximately $284 million in capital investment grants and allowances and $98 million in interest subsidies. In addition, AMD Saxony received advanced payments for interest subsidies amounting to $49 million, of which approximately $18 million is restricted from our access for more than one year, and is therefore included in Other Assets. In addition to the above-mentioned subsidies, AMD Saxony also received $31 million in research and development subsidies through December 29, 2002. Amounts received under the Subsidy Agreement are recorded as a long-term liability on our financial statements and are being amortized to operations ratably over the contractual life of the Subsidy Agreement as a reduction to operating expenses through December of 2008. The historical rates were used to translate the amounts denominated in deutsche marks (converted to euros) into U.S. dollars.

In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (FIN 46). Variable interest entities often are created for a single specified purpose, for example, to facilitate securitization, leasing, hedging, research and development, or other transactions or arrangements. Formerly Consolidation of Certain Special Purpose Entities in its draft form, this interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51, Consolidated Financial Statements, defines what these variable interest entities are and provides guidelines on how to identity them and also on how an enterprise should assess its interests in a variable interest entity to decide whether to consolidate that entity. Generally, FIN 46 applies to variable interest entities created after January 31, 2003, and to variable interest entities in which an enterprise obtains an interest after that date. For existing variable interest entities in which an enterprise holds a variable interest that it acquired before February 1, 2003, the provision of this interpretation will apply no later than the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period beginning after June 15, 2003. Currently, we do not have any variable interest entities, and we do not expect the adoption of FIN 46 will have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition.

The Company accounted for the acquisition using the purchase method and the assets and operations acquired were combined with the Companys Core Products segment. Approximately $2.9 million of the purchase price represented acquired in-process research and development that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use. The $2.9 million was expensed upon the acquisition of Alchemy. In addition, the Company recorded $18.7 million of goodwill, which is not being amortized, based on the residual difference between the amount paid and the fair values assigned to identified tangible and intangible assets using an independent valuation.

Intel has dominated the market for microprocessors used in PCs for many years. Because of its dominant market position, Intel has historically set and controlled x86 microprocessor and PC system standards and, thus, dictated the type of product the market requires of Intel's competitors. In addition, Intel may and does vary prices on its microprocessors and other products at will and thereby affects the margins and profitability of its competitors due to its financial strength and dominant position. Intel also exerts substantial influence over PC manufacturers and their channels of distribution through the "Intel Inside" brand and other marketing programs. Intel invests billions of dollars in, and as a result exerts influence over, many other technology companies. We expect Intel to continue to invest heavily in research and development, new manufacturing facilities and other technology companies, and to remain dominant:

IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AND OTHER CHARGES. In 1998, we recorded a pre-tax charge of $196 million in connection with the Brooks Fiber Properties merger, the MCI merger and asset write-downs and loss contingencies. Brooks Fiber Properties is a leading facilities-based provider of competitive local telecommunications services. This charge included $21 million for employee severance, $17 million for Brooks Fiber Properties direct merger costs, $38 million for conformance of Brooks Fiber Properties accounting policies, $56 million for exit costs under long-term commitments, $31 million for write-down of a permanently impaired investment and $33 million related to asset write-downs and loss contingencies. The $56 million related to long-term commitments includes $33 million of minimum commitments between 1999 and 2008 for leased facilities that we have or will abandon, $19 million related to minimum contractual network lease commitments that expire between 1999 and 2001, for which we will receive no future benefit due to the migration of traffic to owned facilities, and $4 million of other commitments. Because of organizational and operational changes that occurred, management concluded in 1999 that selected leased properties would not be abandoned according to the original plan that was approved by management. Therefore, in 1999 a reversal of a $9 million charge to in-process research and development and other charges was recorded in connection with this plan amendment. Additionally, the $33 million related to asset write-downs and loss contingencies includes $9 million for the decommission of information systems that have no alternative future use, $9 million for the write-down to fair value of assets held for sale that were disposed of in 1998 and $15 million related to legal costs and other items related to Brooks Fiber Properties.
research and development
In connection with 1998 business combinations, we made allocations of the purchase price to acquired in-process research and development totaling $429 million in the first quarter of 1998 related to the CompuServe merger and ANS transaction and $3.1 billion in the third quarter of 1998 related to the MCI merger. These allocations represent the estimated fair value based on risk-adjusted future cash flows related to the incomplete projects. At the date of the respective business combinations, the development of these projects had not yet reached technological feasibility and the research and development in progress had no alternative future uses. Accordingly, these costs were expensed as of the respective acquisition dates.

IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AND OTHER CHARGES. In 1998, the WorldCom group recorded a pre-tax charge of $177 million in connection with the Brooks Fiber Properties merger, the MCI merger and asset write-downs and loss contingencies. This charge included $21 million for employee severance, $17 million for Brooks Fiber Properties direct merger costs, $38 million for conformance of Brooks Fiber Properties accounting policies, $37 million for exit costs under long-term commitments, $31 million for the write-down of a permanently impaired investment and $33 million related to asset write-downs and loss contingencies. The $37 million related to long-term commitments includes $33 million of minimum commitments between 1999 and 2008 for leased facilities that the WorldCom group has or will abandon, and $4 million of other commitments. Because of organizational and operational changes that occurred, management concluded in 1999 that selected leased properties would not be abandoned according to the original plan that was approved by management. Therefore, in 1999 a reversal of a $9 million charge to in-process research and development and other charges was recorded in connection with this plan amendment. Additionally, the $33 million related to asset write-downs and loss contingencies includes $9 million for the decommission of information systems that have no alternative future use, $9 million for the write-down to fair value of assets held for sale that were disposed of in 1998 and $15 million related to legal costs and other items related to Brooks Fiber Properties.

Based on the respective fair values of the related operations allocated to each group, $2.3 billion of the in-process research and development charge was allocated to the WorldCom group. Management believes that this method of allocation provides a reasonable estimate of the in-process research and development charges attributable to each group.

- In 1998, we recorded a pre-tax charge of $196 million in connection with the Brooks Fiber Properties merger, the MCI merger and the asset write-downs and loss contingencies as described below. This charge included $21 million for employee severance, $17 million for Brooks Fiber Properties direct merger costs, $38 million for conformance of Brooks Fiber Properties accounting policies, $56 million for exit costs under long-term commitments, $31 million for write-down of a permanently impaired investment and $33 million related to asset write-downs and loss contingencies associated with the Brooks Fiber Properties merger and the MCI merger. Additionally, in connection with 1998 business combinations, we made allocations of the purchase price to acquired in-process research and development totaling $429 million in the first quarter of 1998 related to the CompuServe Corporation merger and the acquisition of ANS Communications, Inc. and $3.1 billion in the third quarter of 1998 related to the MCI merger.

IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AND OTHER CHARGES. In 1998, the WorldCom group recorded a pre-tax charge of $177 million in connection with the Brooks Fiber Properties merger, the MCI merger and asset write-downs and loss contingencies. This charge included $21 million for employee severance, $17 million for Brooks Fiber Properties direct merger costs, $38 million for conformance of Brooks Fiber Properties accounting policies, $37 million for exit costs under long-term commitments, $31 million for the write-down of a permanently impaired investment and $33 million related to asset

write-downs and loss contingencies. The $37 million related to long-term commitments includes $33 million of minimum commitments between 1999 and 2008 for leased facilities that the WorldCom group has or will abandon, and $4 million of other commitments. Because of organizational and operational changes that occurred, management concluded in 1999 that selected leased properties would not be abandoned according to the original plan that was approved by management. Therefore, in 1999 a reversal of a $9 million charge to in-process research and development and other charges was recorded in connection with this plan amendment. Additionally, the $33 million related to asset write- downs and loss contingencies includes $9 million for the decommission of information systems that have no alternative future use, $9 million for the write-down to fair value of assets held for sale that were disposed of in 1998 and $15 million related to legal costs and other items related to Brooks Fiber Properties.

In connection with 1998 business combinations, WorldCom made allocations of the purchase price to acquired in-process research and development totaling $429 million in the first quarter of 1998 related to the CompuServe merger and ANS transaction and $3.1 billion in the third quarter of 1998 related to the MCI merger. These allocations represent the then estimated fair value based on risk-adjusted future cash flows related to the incomplete projects. At the date of the respective business combinations, the development of these projects had not yet reached technological feasibility and the research and development in progress had no alternative future uses. Accordingly, these costs were expensed as of the respective acquisition dates.

Based on the respective fair values of the related operations allocated to each group, $2.3 billion of the in-process research and development charge was allocated to the WorldCom group. Management believes that this method of allocation provides a reasonable estimate of the in-process research and development charges attributable to each group.

PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES. The effective income tax rate for 2000 was 40.0% of income before taxes versus 41.4% in 1999. The rates are greater than the expected federal statutory rate of 35% primarily due to the amortization of the non-deductible goodwill. Excluding non-deductible amortization of goodwill, our effective income tax rate would have been 35.0% in 2000, and 36.2% in 1999. In 1998, we recorded a tax provision of $877 million on a pretax loss of $1.6 billion. Although we generated a consolidated pretax loss for 1998, permanent non-deductible items aggregating approximately $4.0 billion, including the in-process research and development charges discussed above, resulted in the recognition of taxable income.

r&d
We expended approximately $4,948,000 and $2,719,000 in both internally and externally funded research and development (“R&D”) costs for potential new products and enhancements during the years ended January 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
r&d
We continued various development efforts during fiscal year 2013 for both military and commercial applications. Creating innovative digital, integrated standby devices has been a primary focus of our R&D efforts, along with additional advancements for our industry unique air data instruments. These efforts will provide for an integrated product line from sensors and information processing through primary and backup displays for the flight crew. Further, we plan to continue our design efforts to satisfy our existing contractual obligations as well as our internal development of products for future customer applications. This includes re-engineering of existing products and processes to improve manufacturability, increase reliability, enhance throughput, and reduce production costs.
research and development
Our customers continually seek improvements in the products that we manufacture and market. As a result, in order to meet our customers’ needs, we must continue to develop new products and innovations and enhancements to existing products. Many of our competitors have significantly more capital than we have and as a result have the ability to devote more resources to research and development and to marketing of their products. In order to remain competitive, we must continue to devote a material portion of our financial resources to research and development and there is no assurance that we will be successful in our product improvement efforts in our competitive marketplace.
research and development
Our need to expend resources on research and development to provide our customer base with new and enhanced products as well as to continuously upgrade our process technology and manufacturing capabilities requires us to invest necessary resources on an annual basis. If we elect to expand our operations in future periods, whether as a result of organic growth or through strategic acquisitions, our capital needs would increase. Our ability to raise capital to meet our existing and future needs may depend on a variety of factors, some of which will not be within our control, including investor perceptions of us, our businesses and the industries in which we operate, and general economic conditions. We may be unable to successfully raise additional capital, if needed. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash from operations or raise additional capital in the future, we may have to limit our growth, enter into less favorable financing arrangements, or scale back on planned research and development or upgrades, any of which could have a materially adverse effect on our profitability.

The trend in the aerospace industry continues toward digital cockpits and away from mechanical cockpit instrumentation that was our foundation. During fiscal year 2013, we continued to make progress in our ability to design and manufacture digital instrumentation that is integrated into cockpit flight management systems. We maintained and strengthened our commitment to research and development to further enhance our product line as we anticipate continued movement toward digital cockpits in the aerospace industry. Our new OASIS® multi-function standby display is being promoted in support of this trend. We plan to position ourselves such that we continue to offer both digital and mechanical instrumentation solutions to our customers. While we believe that this strategy will, over time, strengthen our position in the aerospace industry, we cannot guarantee that this strategy will be successful or that we will have access to the capital resources needed to fully support this strategy.

In August 2011, the Budget Control Act reduced the U.S. DoD top line budget by approximately $490 billion through 2021. In addition, U.S. government expenditures are subject to the potential for further reductions, generally referred to as "sequestration". Sequestration would result in additional reductions of approximately $500 billion from the defense top line budget through 2021. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has estimated that sequestration would reduce non-exempt defense discretionary accounts during U.S. government fiscal year 2013 by approximately 9.4% (excluding military personnel accounts). The OMB has further stated that the budget for Overseas Contingency Operations and any unobligated balances in prior year funds would be included in aggregate reductions but has otherwise indicated that it cannot yet assess the impact of sequestration at the program, project and activity level. The U.S. DoD has indicated that such reductions might require the termination of certain, as yet undetermined, procurement programs, and other U.S. government customers, such as NASA and various intelligence agencies, may be required to take comparable actions. Any such impacts could have a material effect on our results of operations, financial position and/or cash flows. With the aforementioned fiscal challenges as a backdrop, the U.S. DoD announced a significant revision to the defense strategy in January 2012. This new strategy prioritized the Asia Pacific and Middle East regions, reduced the number of ground forces, maintained nuclear deterrence and reduced Cold War assets. Additionally, it emphasized the increasing importance of Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C4ISR); Cyber Security; Space; Special Operations; and Unmanned Systems in implementing the nation's security posture. We have been developing organic capabilities to better serve our customers and their emerging needs in these markets, including the continued R&D efforts on both our flush port and legacy probe air data technologies.
r&d
Our senior management regularly reviews the performance of our operations including reviews of key performance metrics and the status of operating initiatives. We review information on the financial performance of the operations, new business opportunities, customer relationships and initiatives, independent research and development (IR&D) activities, human resources, manufacturing effectiveness, cost reduction activities, as well as other subjects.

Selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A) for fiscal year 2013 were $10,152,000, an increase of $2,998,000 compared to $7,154,000 in fiscal year 2012. The net increase was driven primarily by $2.4 million of increased independent research and development costs, most significantly relating to the OASIS® product. In addition, we incurred increased compensation costs and outside services costs, which were partially offset by lower business development costs.

Income tax expense was $920,000 in fiscal year 2013 compared to income tax expense of $436,000 in fiscal year 2012. The effective tax rate of 26.6% in fiscal year 2013 was lower than the effective tax rate of 52.7% in fiscal year 2012 due primarily to the fiscal year 2013 benefit of a research and development tax credit as well as fiscal year 2012 permanent differences. See Note 11 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements”.

Our liquidity will depend on our ability to continue to achieve improved operating results and contain costs related to the development of new products. Sufficient liquidity is necessary to, among other things, (i) satisfy working capital requirements, (ii) fulfill necessary capital spending, and (iii) meet our debt obligations in fiscal year 2014 and beyond. A fiscal year 2013 cash advances from a customer, presented as deferred revenue of $1,669,000 as of January 31, 2013, improved our cash flow from operations as presented on our statement of cash flows for the year ended January 31, 2013. Our failure to improve our operating results could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and could require the implementation of curative measures, including raising capital, deferring planned capital expenditures and research and development efforts, reductions in force, reducing discretionary spending, and selling assets. There can be no assurance that our proposed plans and actions will be successful or that unforeseen circumstances will not require us to seek additional funding sources in the future or effectuate additional plans to conserve liquidity. In addition, there can be no assurance that in the event additional sources of funds are needed, they will be available on acceptable terms, if at all.

Our future capital requirements depend on numerous factors, including research and development, expansion of product lines and other factors. Furthermore, we may need to develop and introduce new or enhanced products, respond to competitive pressures, invest or acquire businesses or technologies or respond to unanticipated requirements or developments, which would require additional resources. Currently, our cash flow from operations alone may not be sufficient to meet these challenges.

Periodically, the Company enters into research and development contracts with customers. When the contracts provide for milestone or other interim payments, the Company will recognize revenue either under the Milestone method or the Multiple-Elements Arrangement method. The Milestone method requires the Company to deem all milestone payments within each contract as either substantive or non-substantive. That conclusion is determined based upon a thorough review of each contract and the Company’s deliverables committed to in each contract. For substantive milestones, the Company concludes that upon achievement of each milestone, the amount of the corresponding defined payment is commensurate with the effort required to achieve such milestone or the value of the delivered item. The payment associated with each milestone relates solely to past performance and is deemed reasonable upon consideration of the deliverables and the payment terms within the contract. For non-substantive milestones, including advance payments, the recognition of such payments are pro-rated to the substantive milestones. Milestones may include, for example, the successful completion of design review or technical review, the submission and acceptance of technical drawings, delivery of hardware, software, spares, test equipment or regulatory agency certifications.

The carrying value of goodwill is reviewed at least annually for impairment and will be reviewed more frequently if current events and circumstances indicate a possible impairment. An impairment loss is charged to expense in the period identified. As current events and circumstances warrant, the Company examines the carrying value of its intangible assets with finite lives, such as capitalized software and development costs, purchased intangibles, and other long-lived assets, to determine whether there are any impairment losses. If indicators of impairment are present and future cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover the asset’s carrying amount, an impairment loss is charged to expense in the period identified. Factors that may cause impairment include negative industry or economic trends or significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results.

We continued various development efforts during fiscal year 2012 for both military and commercial applications. Creating innovative digital, integrated standby devices has been a primary focus of our R&D efforts, along with additional advancements for our industry unique air data instruments. These efforts will provide for an integrated product line from sensors and information processing through primary and backup displays for the flight crew. Further, we plan to continue our design efforts to satisfy our existing contractual obligations as well as our internal development of products for future customer applications. This includes re-engineering of existing products and processes to improve manufacturability, increase reliability, enhance throughput, and reduce production costs.

Our customers continually seek improvements in the products that we manufacture and market. As a result, in order to meet our customers’ needs, we must continue to develop new products and innovations and enhancements to existing products. Many of our competitors have significantly more capital than we have and as a result have the ability to devote more resources to research and development and to marketing of their products. In order to remain competitive, we must continue to devote a material portion of our financial resources to research and development and there is no assurance that we will be successful in our product improvement efforts in our competitive marketplace.

Our need to expend resources on research and development to provide our customer base with new and enhanced products as well as to continuously upgrade our process technology and manufacturing capabilities requires us to invest necessary resources on an annual basis. If we elect to expand our operations in future periods, whether as a result of organic growth or through strategic acquisitions, our capital needs would increase. Our ability to raise capital to meet our existing and future needs may depend on a variety of factors, some of which will not be within our control, including investor perceptions of us, our businesses and the industries in which we operate, and general economic conditions. We may be unable to successfully raise additional capital, if needed. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash from operations or raise additional capital in the future, we may have to limit our growth, enter into less favorable financing arrangements, or scale back on planned research and development or upgrades, any of which could have a materially adverse effect on our profitability.

Occasionally the Company enters into research and development contracts with customers. When the contracts provide for milestone or other interim payments, generally, the Company will recognize revenue when the contract delineates specific and measureable contract performance, attaches a specific value to the deliverable and accomplishment of the deliverable is recognized by the customer. When there is no milestone or other interim payments, revenue is generally recognized at completion.

Our customers continually seek improvements in the products that we manufacture and market. As a result, in order to meet our customers needs, we must continue to develop new products and innovations and enhancements to existing products. Many of our competitors have significantly more capital than we have and as a result have the ability to devote more resources to research and development and to marketing of their products. In order to remain competitive, we must continue to devote a material portion of our financial resources to research and development and there is no assurance that we will be successful in our product improvement efforts in our competitive marketplace.

SG&A expense decreased $306,000, or 4%, to $7,776,000, or 30% of revenue, for fiscal year 2003 from $8,082,000, or 30% of revenue for fiscal year 2002. SG&A expense was 30% of revenues in fiscal year 2003 as well as in fiscal year 2002. The decrease was attributable to decreased commission expenses for sales in Europe and Japan as well as the redirection of engineering resources from internally-funded research and development efforts to customer-funded design work for the Joint Strike Fighter program.

Research at Avionics Specialties in fiscal 2002 was primarily concerned with the development and qualification of the Integrated Multi Function Probe (IMFP). Discussions with the European JAA certification authorities revealed that they require new and very severe icing tests for all new certifications. The severity of these new requirements has required a substantial effort to evaluate and have also required a change in the IMFP heater design during the past year. Qualification of the IMFP for Military programs, including icing, is nearing completion with the civilian (FAA/JAA) qualification tests to follow. Flight- testing of the military versions on the US F-16 and the Korean T-50 will commence early in FY 2003. A third customer for the military version of the IMFP was added during FY 2002 when it was selected for use on the Aermacchi MB339 trainer aircraft. Early in FY 2003, notification was received that a derivative of the IMFP had been selected for use on the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF). The requirements for JSF probe will require a new design based on the IMFP with development beginning in FY 2003. The completion of the IMFP development and the start of the JSF probe development will be the focus of the majority of the Research and Development activities in the next year.

Research and development in fiscal year 2001 continued the development of the new Integrated Multi function Probe (IMFP) and Engine and Vibration Monitoring System (EVMS). The EVMS was successfully installed and demonstrated in helicopters in Norway and China culminating with certification approval of the system by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) in the UK and the Norwegian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA). This system will be slightly modified in fiscal year 2002 to expand its capabilities and increase the number and types of aircraft that it is applicable to. The IMFP development was flight tested by Airbus Industries on an A320 at the end of the year. Further commercial flight testing by Cessna and Dornier is scheduled for early this year. The development of this product for the two current military contracts, Korean T-50 and Lockheed F-16 Block 60 and the future possibility of the Joint Strike Fighter will begin qualification and wind tunnel testing early in fiscal year 2002. The development programs and testing for IMFP, and the installation and certification of the EVMS will dominate the research and development efforts in fiscal year 2002.

iDNA's revenues are significantly concentrated in communications, media and entertainment and iDNA’s clients are concentrated within specific industries including pharmaceuticals, legal and professional services, and financial services. These industries are subject to fluctuations of business communications needs based upon the timing of research and development activities, new product launches, continuing educational support, marketplace communication, general budgetary levels, regulatory changes and general economic trends. Consequently, many of iDNA’s clients will likely be influenced at the same time by similar economic or regulatory factors, which can affect the level of spending for advertising, marketing, promotion and communication services. In the event of a decline, projected decline or delay in such spending, the management of iDNA’s clients may choose to cut back or defer spending for iDNA’s services. It is reasonable to expect that, if one client reduces or delays its spending in response to a major economic factor, other clients will also decide to reduce or delay their spending at approximately the same time. Accordingly, iDNA’s revenues are subject to fluctuations as a result of factors that affect its client’s expenditures.

iDNA's revenues are significantly concentrated in communications, media and entertainment and iDNA's clients are concentrated within specific industries including pharmaceuticals, legal and professional services, and financial services. These industries are subject to fluctuations of business communications needs based upon the timing of research and development activities, new product launches, continuing educational support, marketplace communication, general budgetary levels, regulatory changes and general economic trends. Consequently, many of iDNA's clients will likely be influenced at the same time by similar economic or regulatory factors, which can affect the level of spending for advertising, marketing, promotion and communication services. In the event of a decline, projected decline or delay in such spending, the management of iDNA's clients may choose to cut back on spending for iDNA's services.

Delphax maintains a September 30 fiscal year. The returns for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018 have not yet been filed. Included in the deferred tax balances above and related to Delphax and its subsidiaries are estimated foreign and domestic tax loss carryforwards of $13.4 million and $15.2 million, respectively as well as foreign research and development credit carryforwards of $4.5 million, which are available to offset future income tax. The credits and net operating losses expire in varying amounts beginning in the year 2023. The TCJA repealed the corporate alternative minimum tax and made any minimum tax credit carryforwards to the extent not utilized refundable for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017. As a result, Delphax will be able to receive a refund of its minimum tax credit carryforward of $311,000 beginning in their fiscal year ended September 30, 2019. Previously, a valuation allowance was established against the minimum tax credit carryforward. As a result of the TCJA relating to the refundability of the minimum tax credit carryforward, an income tax benefit was recognized by the Company during the prior period and a long-term income tax receivable was established. Should there be an ownership change for purposes of Section 382 or any equivalent foreign tax rules, the utilization of the previously mentioned carryforwards may be significantly limited. Furthermore, Delphax is currently undergoing bankruptcy proceedings with their Canadian entity (see Note 11) and intends to liquidate both the United Kingdom and French entities as well. The Company anticipates those proceedings will be completed within the next fiscal year. Upon completion, any remaining tax attributes, including net operating losses and credit carryforwards in each respective jurisdiction will be lost. The Company has recorded an outside basis difference in the stock of these entities of $6.4 million, which is the estimated loss that will be recognized in the United States upon their liquidation. See additional information regarding Delphax Canada in Note 11.

As previously noted, the TCJA repealed the corporate alternative minimum tax and made any minimum tax credit carryforwards to the extent not utilized refundable for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017. As a result, Delphax will be able to receive a refund of its minimum tax credit carryforward of $311,000 beginning in their fiscal year ended September 30, 2019. Previously, a valuation allowance was established against the minimum tax credit carryforward. As a result of the TCJA relating to the refundability of the minimum tax credit carryforward, an income tax benefit was recognized by the Company during the current period and a long-term income tax receivable was established. Should there be an ownership change for purposes of Section 382 or any equivalent foreign tax rules, the utilization of the previously mentioned carryforwards may be significantly limited. Furthermore, Delphax is currently undergoing bankruptcy proceedings with their Canadian entity (see Note 10) and intends to liquidate both the United Kingdom and French entities too. The Company anticipates those proceedings will be completed within the next fiscal year. Upon completion, any remaining tax attributes, including net operating losses and credit carryforwards in each respective jurisdiction will be lost. The Company has recorded an outside basis difference in the stock of these entities of $2.3 million which is the estimated loss that will be recognized in the United States upon their liquidation. See additional information regarding Delphax Canada in Note 10. The returns for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017 have not yet been filed.
